M . VAL. MARTIALIS

Et gannitibus improbis lacessas,

Certum est hanc tibi pernegare famam,

Olim quam petis in meis libellis

Qualiscumque legaris ut per orbem. 5
Nam te cui· aliquis sciat fuisse?

Ignotus percas miser necesse est.

Non deerunt tamen hac in urbe forsan

Unus vel duo tresve quattuorve,

Pellem rodere qui velint caninam:

10

Nos hac a scabie tenemus ungues.

bie restricta minantur, et cum jam
latiam—longe alio pacto gannitu
vocis adulant) Here it has a bad
sense, ‘ a hostile snarl ;' unless there
is an allusion to a kind of low adula-
tion to the poet's face, but abuse
behind his back.

3. Cenum cst] ‘1 am resolved to
refuse you to the last this fame
which you ask some (lay to attain
in my books‚⁸ viz. that your name,
worthless as it is, may be read.—
olim, ‘tibi datum iri ;’ or perhaps
to be construed with [effaris.

6. aliquis] Here for quisquam.
See on Ep. 61. 5.

ΕΡ. 257.

7. Iynoius] If you die unknown,
you must die wretched, because you
have not gained your real object, to
become known by your abuse of
me.

10. pellem rodere] He still speaks
of him as a dog, and says one or
two low dogs may possibly be found
lo gnaw a brother dog's hi‹le; though,
according to the proverb, ‘canis ca-
ninam non est.' ‘We‚' says tho
poet, ‘ will not dirty oui· nails with
such a filthy hide‚' i⁴ e. others may
perhaps think it worth their while
{3⁰3ret0rt’ butl will not. Cf. Ep.

2 . 4.

(v. lxii.)

The poet (in a feigned character, probably) offers to open his gardens ιο
any one who will furnish them with seats and sosas.

Iure tuo nostris maneas licet, hospes, in hortis,
Si potes in nudo ponere membra solo,

Aut si portatur tecum tibi magna supellex :
Nam mea iam digitum sustulit hospitibus.

l. -Izcre tuo] Of your own right,
i. e. without that right being ques-
tioned by me.

4, α’ίρίίιιηι sustulit] ‘ Has been
sold to my guests;' i. e. my guests
have used it up just as if they had
bought it at an auction. ‘Tollere

digitum' meant ‘to make a bid.'
Cic. in Verr. ii. 1. 54, ‘Accurmnt
tamen ad tempus tutores: digitum
tollit Junius patruus.' ld. ii. 3. ll,
‘utrum est aequius decumanum pe-
tere—an eum qui digito licitus ait
possidere?'
