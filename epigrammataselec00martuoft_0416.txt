M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Et numeras nostros astricta fronte trientes,
Tanquam de cella sit cadus ille tua.

sorious as Cato the Elder.

(XI. xii.)

A very elegant epigram on the death of a handsome youth by falling
from a tree. The names Amyntas and Iollas are from Virgil‘s Eclogues.

Indulget pecori nimium dum pastor Amyntas
Et gaudet fama luxuriaque gregis,
Cedentes oneri ramos silvamque fluentem
V ieit, concussas ipse secutus opes.
Triste nemus dirae vetuit superesse ruinae 5
Damnavitque regis noxia ligna pater.
Pingues, Lygde, sues habeat vieinus Iollas:
Te satis est nobis annumerare pecus.

l. Indicium] By giving them too
large a seed of mast, or the acorn of
the ilex. He ascended the tree to
shake the boughs, whereas it was
enough for the swine to gather those
fallen; ‘glandemque sues fregere
sub uhnis,' Virg. Georg. ii. 72.

2.fimza] The reputation of their
being fat. and giving well-tasted

ork.

they were ioaded.-sil1·amfluentem,
copiam glandis a ramis caducam.—

‘ Giving way under
or (poetically) the

quaesit-us Hylas urnamque secutus.'
—opes, viz. the shaken down acon-ne.

5. Triste nemus] Funestam arbo-
rem. The tree was cut down and·
used to consume the body.

7. Lysycle] Addressed to a comely
slave, whom the poet warns not to
venture on a similar risk, impelled
by jeaiousy of his neighbour's fatter
swme.

8. annumerare] To count, and not
to fatten. The number of the flocks
and herds was daily returned by the
slaves to the owners. Hence the too
rigid parents in Virg. Ecl. iii. 34,
‘ bis die numerant ambo pecus?
