M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Saepe mihi dieis, Luei carissime Iuli,
“ Scribe aliquid magnum ε desidiosus hemo es.”
Otia da nobis, sed qualia fecerat olim
Maecenas Flacco Vergilioque suo :
Condere victuras temptem per saecula curas 5
Et nomen flammis eripuisse meum.
In steriles nolunt campos iuga ferre iuvenci ε
Pingue solum lassat, sed iuvat ipse labor.

33. du] Si des, scribam, &c.—0tz'a‚
the lcisnre resnlting from easy cir*
viiinstances.

T, 8.] A very elegant couplet.
Evcn oxen prefer to plough a soil

which gives some return for thei1
hbour, though the exet-tion triis
them. Thus, the poet argues, 1 ani
reluctant to work without pay.

ΕΡ. 55. (1. cviii.)

A witty reply to an illiberal patron, who had endeavoured to enlist the

poet as a client.
an author.

He pleads the distance, and (indirectly) his occupation as

Est tibi sitque precor multos crescatque per annos
Pulchra quid-em, verum transtiberina domus ε

At mea Vipsanas spectant cenacula laurus,
Faetus in hae ego sun] iam regione senex.

Migrandum est, ut mane domi te, Galle, salutem : 5
Es tanti, vel si longius illa foret.

Sed tibi nou multum est, unum si praesto togatum :
Multum est, hune unum si mihi, Galle, nego.

Q. domus] A town-house or man-
sion across the Tiber, a low and
‹lisagreeable part of the city, Ep.

3. Vipsanas laurus] The bay-
trees in the gardei), where stands
the porticus Vipsmzcz, the site of
which unfortunately appears to be
unknown. The poet says ‘that his
rit-h friend has a fine house in a dull
part, while he lives 111 a gal-ret in a
pretty pz1rt; and he intimate—s that
he should not like to charge his
abode, which he must do to become
1 daily salutator.

4. reffione] Viz.u1·bis, this division
or district of the city. Perhaps the
neventh, wnere was the ‘pila Tibur-
tina,v near the poet's residenec (the

present Piazza Barberina, Becker,
Gallus, p. l9l).—seneoe, not literally3
but perhaps he means prematurely,
from fatigue.

(5. es tanti] Ironically, ‘you are
quite worth the trouble, even if your
mansion were further off.'

7, 8. sed tibi, &c.] ‘ But, though
it is of no great importance to you,
ifl add one to the number of your
clients, it is agreat matter to rue,
not to allow myself to gos—nesso
mihi, i.e. ‘nolo fieri cliens, nolo
addere hunc unum ceteris? But
others explain, ‘me ipsum negligo,
otium scribendi omitto‚' i.e. *si
non mihi vam, si nego mihi incip-
sum.
