M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Auriferumque Tagum sitiam patriumque Salonem
Et repetam saturae sordida rura casae.

Illa'plaeet tenue, in qua res parva beatum 5
Me facit et tenues luxuriantur opes.

Pascitur hic, ibi pascit egem tepet igne maligno
Hic focus, ingenti lumine lueet ibi.

llic pretiosa fames conturbatorque macellus ;

Mensa ibi divitiis ruris operta sui.

Quattuor hic aestate togae pluresve teruntur3
Auctumnis ibi me quattuor una tegit.

Cum praesta-re tibi possit, Avite, locus.

ΕΡ. 582. (X. xcvii.)

A witty statement of a disappointment in an expected legacy.

Dum levis arsura struitur Libitina papyro,
Dum myrrham et casiam flebilis uxor emit,

Iam scrobe, iam lecto, iam pollinctore parato
Heredem scripsit me Numa: convaluit..

l. papyro] It would seem from
