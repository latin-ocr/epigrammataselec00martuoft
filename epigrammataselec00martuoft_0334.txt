M. VAL. M ARTIALIS

ΕΡ. 486. (IX.1xxv.)

On a cold-bath built of wood, and a hot—bath built of marble; which the
poet thinks a perverse order of things. (For balneum see Ep. 129. l.)

Non silicc duro structilive caemento,

N cc latere coct0‚ quo Semiramis longam

Babylona cinxit, Tucca balneum fecit:

Sed strage nemorum pineaque compage,

Ut navigare Tucca balneo possit. 5
Idem beatas lautus extruit thermas

De marmore omni, quod Carystos invenit,

Quod Phrygia Synnas, Afra quod Nomas mittit

Et quod virenti fonte lavit Eurotas.

Sed ligna desunt: subice balneum thermis.

l. silice duro] Hard volcanicrock‚
or basalt.-ccoemento, ‘ rubble‚' Hor.
carm. iii. l. 35.—latere cor-to, the
burnt hrick of the walls of Babylon,
Herod. i. 179.—lon11am, because the
wall was some fifty-five miles in
extent.

5. naricam—balneo] ⁴ So as to be
able to take a voyage in his bath‚' as
hcing, like a Noah's ark, a pile of
timber made of materials proper for
a ship, and large enough to sail in.
There seems either an intentional
play or a confusion between two dis-
tinct meanings of ‘ in the bath.'

6. Idem, oze] ‘The same Tucca
in his extravagance is building costly
hot-baths of various marbles.' Com-
pare Ep. 296, where an enumeration
is given of the rare marbles used in
thermae.

8. Nomas] Numidia (the land of
:Vomad tribes). See Ep. 426. 8,-
Symzas. A marble called Synnadicum

10

is mentioned together with Numidi-
cum by Pliny, N. H. xxxv. §L as ar-
tificially variegated‚ by a device in-
vented in the reign of Nero, and also
by Statius, Sylv. i. 5. 37-41.

9. virenti sente] Poetically, the

·een colour of the Spartan mai-hle
{fierda antico) is referred to the leafy
sources of the Eurotas; cf. Ep.‘296.
ll, ‘illic Taygeti virent metalla)
The idea seems borrowed from the
tint supposed to be imparted to fleeces
by the virtue of water, Ep. 689. 2.

10. liqna] Viz. to heat the bath.—
subice, &c., ⁸ put the cold-bath in the
fire for the service of the hot-bath.=
(Compare the short form adicit, Ep.
191. 9.) The joke at the end seems
the real point of the epigram: not
that there was any real impropriety
or unfitness in the materiale em-
ployed. This appears clearly from
Ep. 296.

ΕΡ. 487. (ΙΧ. lxxvi.)

The subject the same as Ep. sup 485.

Haec sunt illa mei quae cernitis ora Camoni,
Haec pueri facies primaque forma fuit.

l. mei—Camoni] As from ver. 10
it is clear that the poet is speaking,

mei must mean ‘ my friend.‘—poeoeri‚
from Ep. 485. 2, and from ⁴ prima
