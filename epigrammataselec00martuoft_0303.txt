of Jupiter Capitolinus shall stand 011
the summit of the hill, where was
the ancient Tarpeian rock. Propert.
v. l. 7, “ Tarpeiusque pater nuda de
rupe tonabat,' i.c. before any tem-
ple was built there. It had been re-
built by Vespasian with unusual
pomp and ceremony (Tac. Hist. iv.
53), and again by Domitian (Ep.
979. 2). lta-cent researches have
proved that ‘⁴ the temple of Jupiter
Capitolinus stood on the eminence
now occupied by the (church of)
Ara Caeli, while on the opposite emi-
nence, above the Tarpeian rock. was
the Arx, where stood the temple of
Jupiter Tonans” (Excavations in
Rome,by Alexander Thomson, 1866).

daughter of Titus. See Ep. 281.
