Μ. VAL. MARTIALIS

Nec vani triplices brevesque mappae,

Nec turis veniant leves selibrae,

Sed lances ferat ct scyphos avorum

Aut grandis rcus aut potens amicus, 5
sou quod te potius iuvat capitque.

Sic vincas Noviumque Publiumque

Mandris ct vitreo latrone clusos3

Sic palmam tibi de trigone nudo

Unctae det favor arbiter coronae,

lo

Nec laudet Polybi magis sinistras:
Si quisquam mea dixerit malignus
Atro carmina quae madent veneno,
Ut vocem mihi commodes patronam,

Et quantum poteris, sed usque, clames:

“ Non scripsit meus ista Martialis.”

8. Alandris, διε] In the ‘ludus
latrunculorum: for which see
Becker, Gallus, Exc. ll, Sc. 10;
and Rich's Dict. in v. latro. It was
something midway between draughts
and chess, though more resembling
the latter, especially in the pieces
being of two colours. and in the men
having different values. The point
of the game was to enclose one or
more of the adversary's pieces, so
that they could not move (whence
the proverb, ad incitas rediyere,
to reduce to desperation). The man-
drae were the squares marked on

the board. Thus, mandris et vitreo
latrone clusos means “ having their
men enclosed in mandrae by your
pieces'—these pieces being gene-
rally made of variously coloured

decision.' For the triyon and sinis-
trae, see Ep. 168. ὃς 682. 3: for
