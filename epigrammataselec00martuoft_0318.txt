ΕΡ. 465. (IX. xliii.)

On a bronze statucttc of a sitting IIcrculcs, displaycd on the table of

Nonius Vindex.

IIie qui dura sedens porrecto saxa leone
Mitigat exiguo magnus in aere deus,
Quaeque tulit, spectat resupino sidera voltu,
Cuius laeva calet robore, dextra mero:
Non est fama reeens nee nostri gloria caeli ; 5
Nobile Lysippi munus opusque vides.
Hoc habuit numen Pellaei mensa tyranni,
Qui cito perdomito victor in orbe iacet.
Hune puer ad Libycus iuraverat Hannibal arus3

Iusserat hie Sullani ponere regna trucem.

10

Offensus variae tumidis terroribus aulae
Privatos gaudet nune habitare lares.

thue fuit quondam placidi conviva Molorchi,
Sic voluit docti Vindicis esse deus.

l. porrecto-leone] ⁴ Bystretching
out a lion’s skin,' which sottcns the
seat on a hard rock—z'n aere, worked
or cast in bronze. The statue is a
small one, though the god it re-
presents is one of linge stature.

3. Quae tulit] He sits gazing np
at the stars which hc once bore,
viz. when he held up the heavcns
for Atlas—calet, referring rather to
mero, from its lieating effects, or
from the calda (Ep. 7. 3). The
left hand was represented as holding
the club, the right a goblet.

5. sama recens] ‘A work of
recent repnte? It is an old statuette,
and by a Greek modeller, Lysippus,
a celebrated artist in bronze. con-
temporary with Alexander the Great.
Hercules is said to have been his
favourite subject-nostri caeli, the
Roman graving-tool.—mzc71zos, ‘a pre-
sent from,' perhaps to Alexander,
who was his patron, and is the
‘tyrant of Pella: mentioned in the
next verse—the Pellaeas juvenis
of Juv. x. 168. See Pliny, N. ΙΙ.
xxxiv. ἓ 37 seqq.

8. Qui—jacet] who now lies

buried in that world which he con-
quered in so few years.

9. Hannibal} Livy, xxi. l, ‘Fama
etiam est Hannibalem, annorum
fere novem, pueriliter blandientem
patri Hamilcari ut duceretur in
Hispaniam„quum, perfecto Africo
bello, exercitum eo trajecturus sa-
crificaret, altaribus admotum tactis
sacris jurejurando adactum se, quum
primuni posset, hostem fore populo
Romano.'

10. Sullam] ‘It was this very
Hercules that ordered the savage
Sylla to lay down his kingly power,q
i.e. a dictatorship which was as
absolute as the power of a king.
The poet appears to say, that the
statnette was once the property of
Sulla, and that the god (as the
benefactor of mankind) had exer-
cised an influence over him.

ll. Offensus, &c.] ‘wearied and
disgustcd with the boasts and the
threats of ever-shifting courts, he is
only too glad now to inhabit the
house of a private owner,' Vindex.

deus, ‘ the patron-god.'
