Zoilus had petitioned for the ‘jus trium liberorum* iven in those days ’
by favour even to unmarried people, cf. Epp. 107, 10 . Martial replies,
‘you may be supposed to have seven children, if you like3 but you will
gegerlhave father or mother] i. e. your origin will always be obscure. See

Ius tibi natorum vel septem, Zoile, detur,
Dum matrem nemo det tibi, nemo patrem.

Martial entreats the hcirs of a very small dwarf osa man not to bury
him, for any how the earth must lie heavy on him. We might, however,
constme brevem seprlire, and take the sense thus: ‘ Don‘t bury him in a
thallow grave, but deep3 for no earth will lie lightly on such a seoundrel.'

Heredes, nolite brevem sepelire colonum:
Nam terra est illi quantulacunque gravis.
