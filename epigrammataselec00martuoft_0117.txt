ΕΡ. 140. (ΠΙ. xlvi.)

To Candidus (Ep. 87),with an ingenious and satirica! excuse for not

continuing visits as a client.

Exigis a nobis operam sine fine togatam.
Non eo, libertum sed tibi mitto meum.

‘⁶ Nou est ” inquis ‘⁴ idem.

Multo plus esse probabo :

Vix ego lecticam subsequar, ille feret.

In turbam incideris, cuneos umbone repellet ; 5
Invalidum est nobis ingenuumque latus.

Quidlibet in causa narraveris, ipse tacebo z
At tibi tergeminum mugiet ille sophos.

Lis erit, ingenti faciet convitia voce ι

Esse pudor vetuit fortia verba mihi.
inquis “ praestabis amicus ?''

“Ergo nihil nobis ”
