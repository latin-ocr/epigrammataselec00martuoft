To Faustinus, whom he advises to leave Rome in the spring time, and
retire to his beautiful villa (Ep. 148) at Baiae, commanding a view across

the hay of the town of Anxur.

Sidera iam Tyrius Phrixei respicit agni
Taurus et alternum Castora fugit hiems ;

Ridet ager, vestitur humus, vestitur et arbor,
Ismarium pellex Attica plorat Ityn.

Quos, Faustffle, dies, quales tibi Roma Ravennae 5
Abstulit! o soles, o tunicata quies!

O nemus, o fontes solidumque madentis harenae
Litus et aequoreis splendidus Anxur aquis,

Et non unius spectator lectulus undae,

Qui videt hine puppes fluminis, inde maris!

5. Quos, &e.] ‘What delightful
days at Ravenna (the name of the

See Ep. 648. 173 sup. 544. 5.

7. solidum] Because wot sand is

Pliny, Ep. ii. 17, ad fin.7 ⁴ sive mari
