M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Nec trepidant gestus, sed de discrimine palmae
Securus puer est, sollicitumque pecus.

7. nec trepidant] ‘ Nor arc these
movemcnts (of the boys) unsteadily
done: the boy is sure of winning3

it is the beast alone that is anxious
as to the result,' viz. lest he should
damage it.

ΕΡ. 239. (V. xxxii.)

On a glutton who had nothing left to bequeath to his wife.

Quadrantem Crispus tabulis, Famtine, supremis

Non dedit uxori.

l. quadrantem] Quartam partem.
The sense is, ‘ non dedit uxori tes-

“ Cui dedit ergo ?’' Sibi.

tamento, quia. vivus dederat ventn

ΕΡ. 240. (V. xxxiv.)

This, and Ep. 243, 556, are very elegant and pathetic nicmorials of a
favourite little slave-girl (a verna, or home-bred), hy name Erotion, who

‹lied before her sixth year.

She was evidentlv the property of the

oet,

as well as his pet. The parents, Fronto and* Flaccilla, had been saves
united in contubernium, and perhaps manuniitted, but now dead.

Hanc tibi, Fronto pater, genetrix Flaccilla, puellam
Oscula comme-ndo deliciasque meas,

Parvula ne nigras horrescat Erotion umbras
Oraque Tartarei prodigiosa canis.

Impletura fuit sextae modo frigora brumae, 5
Vixisset totidem ni minus illa dies.

Inter tam veteres ludat lasciva patronos
Et nomen blaeso garriat ore meum.

2. commendo] sc. ‘ego Martialis?
Gronovius would remove the stop
after Flaccilla, and understand
⁴ego, superstes Flaccilla, tibi mor-
tuo, Fronto, comulend0‚' &e. But
the poet is probably speaking in his
own person. both here and at Ep.
2433 and ‘tam veteres patronos'
seems referable to the two aged
parents.

3. vce—horrescat] That, protected
by you, my little Erotion may not
fear the black specu-es, and the
barking of the monster Cerberus.

5. senta, ἃς] ‘She would have
been six years old if she had lived
as many days longer.' See 243. 16,
and 289. 8, ‘ bis senis modo messibus
peractis vix unum puer applicabat
annum]

7. ludat lasciva] Her youth and
her innoccnee, as well as the age of
her parents. will excuse her playful
or seemingly wauton ways. So he
adds, yctrrz'ut nemen meum, let her
lisp my name, and no one will ac-
cuse her of i1np1·op1·iety.—- Mamm,
see Ep. 494. ‘23 558. 10.
