Ut nova dona tibi, Caesar, Nilotica tellus
Miserat hibernas ambitiosa rosas ;

Navita derisit Pharios Memphiticus hortos,
Urbis ut intravit limina prima tuae.

Tantus veris honos et odorae gratia Florae, 5
Tantaque Paestani gloria ruriserat.

Sic quacunque vagus gressumque oculosque ferebat,
Tonsilibus sertis omne rubebat iter.

At tu Romanae iussus iam cedere brumae,

Mitte tuas messes, accipe, Nile, rosas.
