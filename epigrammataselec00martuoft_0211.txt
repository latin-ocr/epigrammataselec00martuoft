ΕΡ. 290. (VI. xxix.)

Non dc plebe domus, nee avarae verna catastae,
Sed domini sancto dignus amore puer,
Munera cum posset nondum sentire patroni,
Glaucia libertus iam Melioris erat.
Moribus hoc formaeque datum: quis blandior illo? 5
Aur quis Apollineo pulchrior ore fuit?
Immodieis brevis est aetas et rara senectus.
Quidquid amas, cupias non placuisse nimis.

l. de plwlu] One of the common
slaves. So Ep. 424. 18, ⁵ non grege
de domiui, sed tua„ Ceste, manus.'--
arurae, because the manymzes dc-
manded extravagant prices. See
Ep. ⁴76. 5.—‘verllae (on whom see
Becker, G<1ll11s,p. ²202) could therc-
fore be sold3 but in that case they
were no longer called vernae.

face.’ Apollo being the type of
youthful beauty.

7. Immodicis] τοῖς περισσοῖς,
to those who are not of the common
way, or who have extraordinary
mei-its. Byron's well-known lines,
‘I never had a young gazelle‚' &C.‚
illustrate this familiar sentiment,
which is expressed here in a very
beautiful verse.

ΕΡ. 291. (VI. xxx.)

To afriend who had reluctantly lent the poet a small sum. Compare

Ep. ⁶275.

Sex sestertia si statim dedisses,
Cum dixti mihi ‘⁶ Sume, tolle, d0n0,’⁷

2. Cum disti, ἃς] ‘lf‚ when
you had said sume, i.e. had con-
sented to iend it, you had supplied
the money immediately, I should
have considered mysclfindebted to
you for 200 (or, felt as grateful as

if that sum had been lent me), not
for six sestertia. Now, however, as
you have been nearly a year in find-
ing me tbe money, l can only say,
I shall not repuy it.'
