EPIGRAMMATA. 33

ΕΡ. 47. (Ι. xcvii.)

On an advocate who would only speak amidst 110180 and clamour, so that
no one could fairly judge of his real talent.

Cum clamant omnes, loqueris tune, Naevole, tantum,
Et te patronum causidicumque putas.

Hac ratione potest nemo non esse disertus.
Ecce, tacent omnes z Naevole, dic aliquid.

ΕΡ. 48. (Ι. xcix.)

On one who grew more stingy as he became richer.

Non plenum modo viciens habebas,

Sed tam prodigus atque liberalis

Et tam lautus eras, Calene, ut omnes

Optarent tibi centiens amici.

Audit vota deus precesque nostras 5
Atque intra, puto, septimas Kalendas
Mortes hoc tibi quattuor dederunt.
At tu sic quasi non foret relictum,
Sed raptum tibi centiens, abisti

In tantam miser esuritionem,

Ut convivia sumptuosiora,

Toto quae semel apparas in anno,
Nigrae sordibus explices monetae,
Et septem veteres tui sodales
