xviii LIFE AND WRITINGS

Colosseum (which appears to be referred to in Ep. 5227
as ‘ theatrum’).

In writing epigrams Martial did not profess to be the
founder of the style, in the sense that Horace claimed to
have introduced lyric verse into Latium. On the con-
trary, he preferred to follow Catullus, Marsus, and Pedo
Albinovanus ε

‘ Sit locus et nostris aliqua tibi parte libellis,
Qua Pedo, qua Marsus, quaque Catullus erit,'

he says (Ep. 216) in writing to a friend3 of Catullus
especially he often expresses his admiration¹. In some
sense it may be said, as Dr. Smith observes (Classical
Dict.), that ‘he first placed the epigram upon the
narrow basis which it now occupies, and from his time
the term has been in a great measure restricted to denote
a short poem, in which all the thoughts and expressions
converge to one sharp point, which forms the termina-
tion of the piece.’ In point of fact, however, many of
the epigrams of Catullus resemble those of Martial both
in their character and their length3 and it is but fair
to regard Catullus as the first Roman epigrammatist.
Martial as clearly and avowedly imitated him as Persius
did Horace.

It would be unfair to regard Martial merely as a
composer of lampeons in verse, or esteem him only as a
satirist or a wit, though he occupies the first place in
both these respects. He was a poet of more than ordi-
nary merit, certainly the first of the age in which he lived.
His style has a singular charm from its ever-varying

¹E. g. in Ep. 568. 16. The epithets doctus, tener, argutus,
facundus, &c., are applied to him.
