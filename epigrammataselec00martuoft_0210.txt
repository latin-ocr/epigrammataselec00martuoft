M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Est tibi, qnae patria signatur imagine voltus,
Testis maternae nata pudicitiae.

Tu tamen annoso nimium no parce Falerno, 5
Et potins plenos aere relinque cados.

Sit pia, sit locuples, sed potet filia mustum ε
Amphora cum domina nunc nova ssat anns.

Caecuba non solos vindemia nutriat orbos:

Possunt et patres vivere, erede mihi.

tota dat0.'

7. pia] Affectionate‚ fond of her
father. ‘I ‹lon't object to her loving
you, and wishing to keep every re-
miniscence of you, nor to her being
lcft well “ff3 but let her have new
wine to drink, and if she must have
old wine, let her store it now, that
it may grow old with herself.'

9. caecam] Such precious wines
ought not to be reserved for childless
old bachelors: even a family man
like you may enjoy himself over a
gcnial bottle3 believe me, who can
attest it from experience.' The orla
would drink their old wine, because
they had no one to leave it to.

ΕΡ. 289. (VI. xxviii.)

This and the next epigram are on the death of Glaucias. a faithful
lilim-tm of Melior Attedius. This man is mentioned (Ep. 98. 7), with au

allusion to his wealth and hospitality.

Libertus Melioris ille notus,

Tota qui cecidit dolente Roma,

Cari deliciae breves patroni,

Hoc sub marmore Glaucias humatus
Iuncto Flaminiae iacet sepulcro:
Castus moribus, integer pudore,
Velox ingenio, decore felix.

3. breves] ‘Short—lived.'
