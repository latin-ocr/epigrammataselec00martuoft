MARTIALIS

·Quantum noluerat ferre rogatus Atlas,
Et possis ipsum tu deridere Latinum:
Non potes in nugas dicere plura meas,

Ipse cgo quam dixi.

Quid dentem dente iuvabit ὓ

Rodere? carne opus cst, si satur esse velis.

Nc perdas operam: qui se mirantur, in illos
Virus habe, nos hacc novimus esse nihil.

Non tamen hoc nimium nihil est, si candidus aure,
Nec matutina si mihi fronte venis. 10

Omnis in hoc gracili XENIORUM turba libello
