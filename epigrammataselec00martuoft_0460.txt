ΕΡ. 676. (XII. ixx.)

Aper, after protesting as a poor man against drinking in the baths, bim-
self carries the custom to excess after becouiing rich.

Lintea ferret Apro vatius cum vernula nuper
Et supra togulam lusca sederet anus,
Atque olei stillam daret enterocelicus unctor,
Udorum tetricus censor et asper erat.
Frangendos calices effundendumque Falernum ὁ
Clamabat, biberet qui modo lotus eques.
A sene sed postquam patruo venere trecenta,
Sobrius a thermis nescit abire domum.
O quantum diatreta valent et quinque comati!

Tunc, cum pauper erat, non sitiebat Aper.

9. diatreta] “Vases or drinking-
cups of cut-glass or precious stones,
ground by the wheel iu such a man·
ner that the patterns upon them not
only stood out in relies, but uere
hored completely through, so as to
form a piece of open tracery‚ like
network.” Rich's Dictionary‚ in v.,
where an engraving from an antique
is given. The sense is, ‘now that
he has costly cups to drink out of
(and to display). and five clients who
wear their hair long (Ep. 91. 5), not
merely close-cropped slaves, then
he can fall into the same vice as the
rest? Or comati may refer to hand-
