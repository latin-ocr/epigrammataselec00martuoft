ΕΡ. 117. (ΠΙ. xi.)

- An answer to one Quintus, who seems to have been offended by Ep. 115,
and who ‹lenied that the object of his affection was one-eyed‚ or her naute
Thais. The poet argues that Thais has only a fancied resemblance to the
name Lais, and he jocosely adds, that if Quintus does not like Thais,
Sextus may take her, by which he means, that the public will equally
guess who is meant, whether he be called Quintus or Sextus.

Si tua nee Thais nee lusca est, Quinte, puella,
Cur in te fitetum distichon esse putas?

Sed simile est aliquid: pro Laide Thaida dixi.
Die mihi, quid simile est Thais et Hermione?

Tu tamen es Quintus: mutemus nomen amantis: ,η’
Si non vult Quintus Thaida, Sextus amet.

Against a stingy host, who while he attended to the minor wants of his
gnests‚ gave them nothing to eat.

Convivis here, sed nihil scidisti.
