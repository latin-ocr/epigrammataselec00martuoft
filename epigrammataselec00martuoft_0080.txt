Tac. Ann. xiii. 27, *Quippe lato fusum id coi-pns' (viz. lil›crti)‚- *at
plurimis equitum, plerisque senatoribus, non aliunde originem trahi)

Rufe, vides illum subsellia prima terentem,
Cuius et hine lueet sardonychata manus

Quaeque Tyron totiens epotavere lacernae
Et toga non tactas vincere iussa nives,

Cuius olet toto pinguis coma Marcelliano 5
Et splendent volso brachia trita pilo;

’ Non hesterna sedet lunata lingula planta,

Coccina non laesum pingit aluta pedem,

Et numerosa linunt stellantem s‘plenia frontem.

Ignoras qujd sit? splenia tolle, leges.

1. subsellia prima] From Iunafa
planta, in ver. 7, it is clear that a
senator, and not an cqueS, is meant.
The ‘first seats' mean therefore
the προεδρία, or the lowest tier of
alh—et Ῐιίηο lacet, ⁴ is seen to glitter
even from where we sits—sardony-
chata, ‘ adorned with a sardonyx in
his ring.q An adjective formed like
coccinatus, amethystinatus, Canu-
sinatus, capillatuS‚ togatus, &c.

3. totiens, &c.] The most costly
specimens of eloth were dipped more
than once in the sea-purple, and
ralled dibapha. — epotavere, ⁴ have
drained,' ‘drunk up all Tyres or
the stores of Tyrian dye. Jnv. x.
176, ‘ credimus altos defecisse amnes
epotaque flumina Medo prandentes
These lacernae (mantles worn over
the toga) were often very expensive.
Ep. 196. 5, ‘millibus decem dixti
Emptas lacernas munus esse Pom-
pullae.'

4.jzcssa] Viz. by express orders
given to tliesicllr).

5. ,Marcellianzmfl Like Cosmia-
num‚ Capelliannm (Ep. 603. 17),
which were compounds bearing the
name of the inventmz—volso pilo,
⁴ the hairs being pulled out' with
the tweezers, volsellae. This was a
common cnstmi with Roman fops,

or a depilator-y was used, e. g. resin.
See Ep. 558. ὃ 3 (357. 21.

7. lin-(sula, ‘ the latcliet‚' so called

from its tongue-shape. A fresh ri-
band or shoe-tie was used by this
man every day 3 hence non hesterna,
ἃς. (Rich, however, in v. lz'yzda,
says it means ‘⁴ the lapelle or lappet
on each sido of a shoe⁷ through
which the strings that tied iton to
the feet were passe‹l.'' This ex-
planation does not seem to suit the
present passage.) For the red shoe,
or rather boot„ of the senator, with
the C or crescent affixe<L see Mr.
Mayor's learned and copious note
on Juv. vii. loz—coccina, dyecl
with, or rather of the colour of,
the preparation from the oak—gall‚
corvus (ψοινικίς). Our red morocco,
perhaps, represents it. Red boots
