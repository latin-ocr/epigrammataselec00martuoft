ΕΡ. 484. (IX. lxxiii.)

On a cobbler who bad smeeeded, as client, to the estates of his deceased

patron. Compare Ep. 122.

Dentibus antiquas solitus producere pelles
Et mordere luto putre vetusque solum,
Praenestina tenes decepti rura patroni,
In quibus indignor si tibi cella fuit.
At mc litterulas stulti docuere parentes:
Quid cum grammaticis rhetoribusque mihi ἓ
Frange leves calamos ct scinde, Thalia, libello
Si dare sutori calceus ista potest.

l. producere] To draw out, i. e.
stictch, with your tceth old scraps of
letamen-solum, soleam3 ² to gnaw
and bite a shoe—sole rotten with niud
and worn out with αρε]

3. patroni] See Ep. 50. 9,-de-
cepti, viz. deceived in yourcharacter,
and in thinking you worthy of the
1·ewa1·d.—z·ndz2qnor, &c.‚ 6Ι am in-
dignant at the idea of your formerly
having had even a slave's hut to live

7. At me, &c.] ‘Mys foolish parents
sent me to a grammar school, and to
leam the useless and unprofitable art
0f1·hetoric.' On the poverty of some
of these men see Juv. vii. 145—9.

9. Frcmsle] Cf. Juv. vii. 27, ‘si-angre
miser calamos vigilataque proelia
dele.'—z'stc1, viz. rura ς properly ⁴ those
lauds of yours.' He addresses, not
Thalia, but the sutor, as at the begin-
ning. This is certainly awkward, aa
we have ‘sutori' not ‘ tibi, sutmz’
Or is the sense, ‘ ista, quae vides .'⁴'

ΕΡ. 485. (lx. lxxiv.)

On a cerea inmyo, or bust of a young man, which the father had repre-
sented as an infant, lest the real likeness should awake too keen regrets.

Ep. 487 is on the same subject.

Effigiem tantum pueri pictura Camoni
Servat, et infantis parva figura manet.

Florentes nulla signavit imagine voltus,
Dum timet ora pius muta videre pater.

l. pictura] ‘The painting (painted
effigy) preserves the likeness of Ca-
monus only as a boy·‚ and the early
form which he had as an infant is
still retained) Cf. Juv. viii. 2, ‘pic-
tos ostendere vultus maj01·um‚' and
Mr. Mayor’s note.

53. Florentes] ‘The countenanoe,
as it appeared in the ”rime ossife, the

affectionate father has not stampcnl
with an)v likeness, in his fem· to look
upon a face that can no longer-speak
to him.'-The meaning of muta is,
that even the silent portum of the
face as it was would ove-rpower his
feelinprS.-—sz]qnaz·il‚ cf. Ep. 288, 3,
