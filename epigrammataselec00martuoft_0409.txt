ΕΡ. 601. (XI. xviii.)

Martial complains os the extreme smalluess of the farm that Lupus had
so bountisully bestowed on him, and says that one dinner would bave been
worth much more. A vel-v elever and witty epigram. This farm is alluded

to in Epp. 431. 63 501. 7 3⁷ 553. 9.

Donasti, Lupo, rus sub urbe nobis3

Sed rus est mihi maius in fenestra.

Rus hoe dicere, rus potes vocare?

In quo ruta facit nemus Dianae,

Argutae tegit ala quod cicadae, 5
Quod formica die comedit uno,

Clusae cui folium rosae corona est3

In quo non magis invenitur herba,

Quam Cosmi folium piperve crudum3

In quo nec cucumis iacere rectus,

10

Nec serpens habitare tota possit,
Erucam male pascit hortus unam,
Consumpto moritur culex salicto,

Et talpa est mihi fossor atque arator.

Non boletus hiare, non mariscae

15

Ridere'aut violae patere possunt.
Fines mus populatur et colono
Tanquam sus Calydonius timetur,
Et sublata volantis ungue Prognes

In nido seges est hirundinin03

2.] This line seems to show that
the Romans used to keep flowers and
perhaps herbs in their windows as
we do still. Cf.a1.<0 Plin. H. N. xix.
19, ‘ Jatn in fenestris suis plebs
urbana in imagine hortorum quotidi-
ana oculisrum praebebant, autequam
praefigi prospectus omncs coegit mul-
titudinis innumeratae saeva latroci-
natio.' The Greek κῆποι Ἀδώνιδος
were similar couti-ivanceS.

3. hoc] Emphatic : ⁸ call this a
farm. indeed, in which a rue-plant
makes a Diana's grove3 which is
covered by the wing of a cicala3
which an ant cate up in one day3
which gives me but the leaf osa rose-
bud for a chaplet: in which no green
thing is any more to be found than

20

the fragrant leaf which Cosmus uses
for his perfumes, or fresh pepper.'
Cf. Hor. Ep. i. 14. 23, ‘angulus iste
feret piper et thus ocius uvas—cru-
dum, green, uurip03 opposed to ‘ ru·
gosum,' Pers. v. 55.

Ill. tota] without hanging out its
tai .

12. Erucam, &c.] ‘ The gal-den
barely fceds one caterpillar‚ and the
gnat dies because it has caten up the
willow bed?

17. mus, &c.] The mouse com-
mits as much havoc, and is as much
‹li-ended by the tenant, as would be
the ravages of the Calydonian bour.

19. sublata, &c.] My whole crop
is only enough to furnish the strawt
for a swallow’s nest.
