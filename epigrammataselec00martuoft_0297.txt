was the earliest mcal of the day⁷
probably about the third or fourth
honr, whilst the prandium was at
the sixth (the French deieuner).
The question raised on Martial,

xiv. 223, ‘Sui-gite; jam vendit
pueris jantacula pist01·‚' as to whe-
ther this meal was not confined to
children, is negatived by this pas-

Invida purpureos urat ne bruma racemos
Et gelidum Bacchi munera frigus edat,
Condita perspicua vivit vindemia gemma 5
Et tegitur felix, nee tamen uva latet.
Femineum lueet sie per bombycina corpu&
