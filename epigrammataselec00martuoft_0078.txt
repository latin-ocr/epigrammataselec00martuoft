MARTIALIS

ΕΡ. 75. (Π. xviii.)

1¹0 ιι rer, or wealthy citizen, who courted still richer pcople‚ just as he
was himself courtcd by those below him. The poet shows that the great

ιιιιιιι is therefore himself, af·te1 all, only ιι client.

Compare Ep. 516.

Capto tuam, pudet. heu, sed capto, Maxime, cenam,
Tu captas aliam: iam sumus ergo pares.

Mane salutatum venio, tu diceris isse
Ante salutatum: iam sumus ergo pares.

Sum eomes ipse tuus tumidique anteambulo regis, 5
Tu eomes alterius: iam sumus ergo pares.

Esse sat est servum, iam nolo vicarius esse.
Qui rex est, regem, Maxime, non habeat.

l. capto] ‘I use every art to be
asked to dine with you, though I
am half-ashamed to avow it3 you
do the same to othei-33 so in this
respect we are quite. He uses
pares to vex Maximus, who thought
himself fir above Martial, and by
no means οιι ιι level.

3. dzceris] viz. by the selvants
at your house. ‘You are also, he
5ιί)5 an attendant at the [mes of
the gr3eat so ιιιιι Ι; so here again
we are equals.' The salutator was
virtually a client; and even though
nolding the highest office, did not
disdain the sportula, Juv. i. 96,

5. comes] Viz. as ιι client. -anteam-
bulo, see Ep. 114. 2 565. 3. Juv. x.
44. praecedentia loiigi Agminis offi-
cias in reference to clients walking

befme the sella of the patron; and zh.
vii. 142, ‘togati antepedes. -νριΙίε,
the g1·eatinan,' viz. youlself, Ep. 229.
13, tumidique vocant haec mune-'1 a
1·egcs.'--7³art²s, a third point of re-
εθιῐιὶιῙι mee οι· purity.

7. sat est]‘ It is bad enough to
be a slave oneself.1dont like to
be the slave of ιι slave. A man who
is ιι rem must not have another rex
over him, οι· he is no ret, but a
servus.' Compare Ep. 97, and ii.
32. 7, ‘ non bene, crede mihi, servo
servitur amico: Sit liber, dominus
qui volet esse meus. ’ Via-arius was
ιιιι under slave⁷ or help er of an
upper slave, ordinarius. See Becker
Gallus, p. 204. Hor. Sat. ii 79,

‘sive vicarius est, qui servo paret, —-
seu conservus-⁹

many liberal offers, but done nothing.
