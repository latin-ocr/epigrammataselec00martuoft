EPIGRAMMATA.

O Iuliarum dedecus Kalendarum,

Vidi, Vacerra, sarcinas tuas, vidi;

Quas non retentas pensione pro bima

Portabat uxor rufa crinibus septem

Et cum sorore cana mater ingenti. 5
Furias putavi nocte Ditis emersas.

Has tu priores frigore et fame siccus

Et non recenti pallidus magis buxo

Irus tuorum temporum sequebaris.

Migrare clivom crederes Aricinum.

Plant. Mostell. i. 3. 69, ancl Mil.
Glor. 792, ⁶ ut matronarum niodo
Capite compto crines vittasque habeat
adsimuletque se Tuam esse uxorem.'
This is the meaning of ‘vinxit et

broken wine-jar was put under a
rusty brazier? Compare Propert. v.
5. 75, ‘ sit tumulus lenae curto vetus
