fuit, in quo colossus centum viginti pedum staret ipsius effigie.’ This colos-
sus was afterwards altered into a figure of the sun by Vespasian, Suet. Vesp.
ξ 18, who speaks of‘ colossi refector? and again by Domitian, who seems to
have conver-ted lt into a likeness of himself. See on Epp. 34. 73 102. 3.

Hic ubi sidereus propius videt astra colossus
Et crescunt media pegmata celsa via,
Invidiosa feri radiabant atria regis
Unaque iam tota stabat in urbe domus.

Hic ubi conspicui venerabilis Amphitheatri

0·

Erigit-ur moles, stagna Neronis erant.
Hic ubi miramur velocia munera thermas,
Abstulerat miseris tecta superbus ager.
Claudia diffusas ubi porticus explicat umbras,

Ultima pars aulae deficientis erat.

Reddita Roma sibi est et sunt te praeside, Caesar,
Deliciae populi, quae fuerant domini.

2. peymala] See 410. 3.—cresczmt‚
because these machines were con-
structed so as suddenly to rise οι·
lengthen themselves. The meaning
of media via is obscure. The poet
apparently means to say, that the
ground once occupied by the invi-
dious pile of the savage king, i.e.
Nero, is now sgiven to the public, and
devoted to their amusement. The
rond, he seems to say, is now made
so wide, that these pie-(smalcz are
worked in the middle of them, and
yet allow room to pass.

6. είαρηα] 'l'his was als-0 a part of
Nero's new palace. Suet. Ner. §tlh
‘ item stagnum maris instar, circum
septum aedificiis ad urbium speciem.
Rura insuper, arvis atquo vinetis ct
past-uis silvisque varia, cum multi-
tudine omnis generis pecudum ac
ferarum? The latter sentence refers
to the superbus affer, which had been
made by clcaring away the houses
oecupying the site. So also Tac.
Ann. xv. 42, ‘ceterum Nero usus
ost patriae ruinis, extruxitque do-

mum in qua haud perinde gemmae
et aurum miraculo essent, solita pri-
dem et luxu vulgata, quam arva et
stagna et in modum solitudinum hinc
silvae, inde aperta spatia et pro-
spectus.⁹

7. thermas] Hot baths built by
Titus (Epp. 125. 153 134. 6)‚and
called velocia, i. e. subitaria, from
the haste with which they were
ereetcd.

9. arplieat] See Ep. 41. 2, ‘longas
porticus explicat ruinas.' The Clau-
dian piazzal one of the many colo-
nadcd promcnadcs„ ‘porticus amoeni
tati dicatae,' Tac. Anu, XV. 40, is be-
lieved to be the same as the ‘ porticus
Liviae? Pliny, N. H⁴ xiv. l, ἓ 11,
‘una vitis Romae in Liviae porti-
rihus subdiales inambulationes um-
brosis pergulis epm-at)

10. deficientis] ληγούσης, ‘leav-
ing offi' i. e. near the Esquiliae.

ll. Reddita, &eff Cf. Ep. 365. 10,
‘nunc Roma θεῖς nuper magna ta-
berna fuit)
