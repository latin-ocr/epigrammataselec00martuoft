He also refers to xiv. 126, ‘ Pauperis est munus³ sed non est pauperis usus;
Hanc tibi pro laena mittimus cnm-omma? Juv. vi. 246, ‘ Endromidas
Tyrias et femineum ceroma Quis nescitP' It is mentioned also, Juv.
iii. 103, ‘Igniculum brumae si tempore poscas, Accipit endromiden.'

or perhaps ‘g1·casy,' from the dirt
in the wool, or the oil, used in
spinning or weaving it. See Ep.

yona, a game played by three people,
in which they threw a ball from one
to the other, catching it before it
reached the ground. The left hand
was used principally (cf. Ep. 371. 93
682. 3, where the parasite is laughed
at for cateliing it with both hands,
and xiv. 46, ⁴ Si me mobilibus scis
expulsare sinistris Sum tua3 si nescis,
rustice. reddcpilam'). W⁷hen ‘ex-
pulsare' refers to the form of the
games, ‘expulsim ludere' was op-
posed to ‘ datatin1,⁹ which latter was
said of two people throwing the
ball from one to the other: the ‘ex-
pulsim ludere’ is obscure. On the
whole subject of games of ball, cf.
Becker, Gallus, Sc. vii. Exc. ii.

p 6. harpasta] Petron. 27, ‘ soleatus
pila sparsiva exercebatur, nec eam
amplius repetebat quac terram con-
tigerat, sed follem (a bag) plenum
habebat servus sufficiebatque luden-
tibus: alter (servus) numeiabat pilas,
non quidem eas quae inter manus
lusu expellente vibrabant, sed cas
quae in terram decidebant? In this
ganne a ball (or more probably balls)
was thrown amongr the playerS‚ who
had to scramble for them3 hence,
perhaps, the proverb, ‘ Mea pila est,'
and rapis, in allusion to the (leri-
vation from ἁρπάζειν, Athenaeus
εει-κε, συνιστάμενοι πρὸς ἀλλήλους
καὶ ἀποκωλύων-τες ὺπαρπάσαι τὸν
μεταξὺ διαπονοῦσι, and speaks ofit
as a very severe exercise. It is
mentioned, iii. 67, ‘ Harpasto quoque
subligata ludit‚' and xiv. 48.

7. fillis] The largest of the balls
z our football, struck with the fist
or arm. Cf. Plaut. Rud. iii. 416,
‘Ego tc follem pugillatorium fa-
ciam.' It was a vcry easy game.

tis mihi convenit aetas. Folle decet

must mean light3 others have re-
ferred it to the ‘paganica‚' which
(xiv. 45) was stuffed with feathers;
but the epithet lazi agrees better
with ‘follisss as may be seen from
that same passage, ⁴ Haec quae diffi-
