Creta (ledit magnum, maius dedit Africa nomen,
Scipio quod vietor quodque Metellus habet3

Nobilius domito tribuit Germania Rheno,
Et puer 1166 dignus nomine, Caesar, eras.

Frater Idumaeos meruit oum patre triumphos, 5
Quae datur ex Chattis laurea, tota tua est.

won his triumph over Judaea with

the victory over the Chatti was all
your own.' Suet. Dom. ξ 6, ‘de

To Sextus, who was really insolvent, while 116 boasted that he had no

debts.

A debtor implies a orechter,- and trusting or lending money

implies that the borrower at least has the means, if not always the will,

to repay.

Sexte, nihil debes, nil debes, Sexte, fatemur,
Debet enim, si quis solvere, Sexte, potest.

An apology to Decianus for not visiting him more frequently, on tho

Ne valeam, si non totis, Dec-iane, diebus
Et tecum totis noctibus esse velim.

Sed duo sunt quae nos disiungunt milia passum:
Quattuor haec fiunt, cum rediturus eam.

4. cum rediturus eam] ‘ Quia
mihi redeundum est 3' not ‘ quotiens
eo rediturus) ‘ We live two miles

apart, and these become four, since
1 have to make the return journey!
