were persuaded to chango their load‚ and carry his disabled master 1101110.
who, to all intentS, was as dead ns the corpse itself. There is a play on

Gallus, ‘a GauL' and also a ‘ eunuch,' and in that sense ι[1101111110]

Dum repetit sera conductos nocte penates
Lingonus a Tecta Flaminiaque recens,
Expulit offenso vitiatum pollice talum
Et iacuit toto corpore fusus humi.

Quid faceret Gallus, qua 50 ratione moveret?

ἰή

Ingenti domino servulus 1111115 erat,

Tam macer, ut minimam posset vix ferre lucernam:
Succurrit misero 005115 opemque tulit.

Quattuor inscripti portabant vile cadaver,

Accipit infelix qualia mille rogus.

Hos comes invalidus summissa voce precatur,
Ut quocunque velint, eorpus inane ferant.

Permutatur onus stipataque tollitur alte
Grandis in angusta sarcina sandapila.
