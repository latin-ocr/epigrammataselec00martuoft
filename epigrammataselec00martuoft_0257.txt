ΕΡ. 370. (VII. lxix.)
A eulogv on Theophila, the espoused of Canius, praising her for her

learning and probity.

Haec est illa tibi promissa Theophila, Cani,
Cuius Cecropia pectora voce madent.
Hanc sibi iure petat magni senis Atticus hortus,
Nec minus esse suam Stoica turba velit.
Vivet opus quodcunque per has emiseris aures3 5
Tam non femineum, nec populare sapit.
Non tua Pantaenis nimium se praeferat illi,
Quamvis Pierio sit bene nota choro.
Carmina fingentem Sappho laudavit amatrix:

Castior haec, et non doctior illa fuit.

1. ΤΙιεόρΙιὶἶα] The ο is long, by
the reduplication of the ‘p‚' nasi
Theop-phila. So we find ὅ(π ιρις
:is an old form of ὄφις. and others
σκύπφος, ὄκχος, &c.

2. madent, δια] Graeca. lingna
erudita. See on 359. 5.

3. Atticus hortus] ‘ The Academns‚
in which Plato taught, may justly
claim her as its own) Others read,
with a few MSS„ altus in hortis,
⁸ he who was brought up in (i. e. a
disciple in) the gardens of the great
man of old‚' referring it to Epicurus
rather than Plato.

5. Vivet, &c.] VVhatever work
you may publish, after it has passed
her criticism, will live, such a strong
and manly judgment she has. and
superior to the vulgar. Hor. Ep. i.

10

12. 15, ‘ Nil parvum sapias et adhuc
sublimia cures?

7. Pantaenis] Α poetess of the
time, otherwise unknown.

9.] There is some obscurity in this
line, as the antithesis evidently in-
tended seems faulty, To remedy
this, ⁴ laudarit ’ has been proposed:
‘ Sappho the lover would praise her
poet1·}·.'-—a1›1‹1t7·12r seems to mean
ιειιῃοῐόιιε,ἱ in reference to castior,
in the next verse. But to whom

fingyentem refers is by no means

clear. If we were to read αηιαίον,
the sense would be better. ‘Her
lover (Phaon) praised Sappho when
composing poetry3 so do you praisse
Theophila, who is quite as elever,
and more chaste)

ΕΡ. 371. (vn. lxxii.)

Martial begs Paulus to patronize his poems; and if any one brings out
books in his name, which attack any person venomously‚ to assei-t that
they are not Martial's work. If he will do sc, the poet wishes him wealth

and success.

Gratus sic tibi, Paule, sit December,

l. Gratus] Bringing you a good
return. Cf. ‘ingrata spatia campi,'

Epist& 4.—sic‚ answered by ‘ut‚'
V. .
