OF THE POET. xix

freshness and brillianey ; in lueidness and appropriateuess
of expression it is surpassed by none. He is neither heavy
nor turgid, as Silius Italicus, Statius, and Lucan too often
are ; and though he lived and wrote in what is called the
Silver Age of Roman literature, the purity of the Latinity
is as remarkable in Martial as in the letters of the younger
Pliny. No author, perhaps, when once understood, is
more likely or more deserving to become a lasting
favourite with those who have a natural taste for wit,
sareasm, and repartee. The conditions of understanding
Martial are an accurate and extensive knowledge of
Roman topography and arehaeology. To the seienee of
these his writings in themselves contfflbute, as has already
been intimated, as much, perhaps, as all the rest of the
Roman poets taken together.

The death of the poet-—or at least the report of his
death—is bewailed by Pliny in an interesting letter,
Epist. iii. 21. ‘I hear,’ he says, ‘of the deeease of
Valerius Martialis, and am sorry for it. He was a man
of genius, acute and keen, and one who in his writings
showed the greatest amount of wit, gall, and yet fairness’
(candoris). He quotes in this letter ten verses from book
x. 19 (Ep. 522.12—21), and eoneludes with these re·
markable words : ‘ What ean be given to a man greater
than glory, praise, and eternity? Perhaps, however, his
writings will not last for ever. Perhaps they will not:
yet he wrote them with the impression that they would.'
How justly Pliny estimated the hopes and the ambition
of our poet, may be 50011 from Epp. 224. 4, and 389. 5, 6;
508. 7, Sao. that Pliny calls his fairness is shown by the
repeated protests which the poet makes against the
charge ofillnature, brought by his enemies against his
more satirieal epigrams. ‘Absit a jocorum nostrorum
