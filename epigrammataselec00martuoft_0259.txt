ΕΡ. 372. (VII. lxxiii.)

Martial wishes to know where he is to go to salute Maximus: for he ha·
so many houses, that he lives nowhere in particular.

Esquiliis domus est, domus est tibi colle Dianae
Et tua patricius eulmina vicus habet:

Hine viduae Cybeles, illine sacraria Vestae,
Inde novum, veterem prospieis inde Iovem.

Dio, ubi conveniam, die, qua te parte requiram: 5
Quisquis ubique habitat, Maxime, nusquam habitat.

l. colle Dianae] On the Aven-
tine, where wasa temple of Diana
(cf. vi. 64. 13„ ‘ Laudat Aventinae
vicinus Sura Dianae'), built at the
instigation of Servius Tullius, by
the Latins and Romans jointly, in
imitation of the temple at Ephesus.
Cf. Liv. i. 45. Hence Proper-t. V.
8. 29, ‘ Phyllis Aventinae quaedam
est vicina Dianae.'

2. patricius—vicus] Under the
Esquiline, where the patricians were

commanded by Servius Tullius to
dwell.-—culmina, see Ep. 198. 10.

3. Ηὶηε, &c.] From the Aventine
you see the temple of the widowed
Cybele (i. e. deprived of her lover
and worshipper Atys), and the newly
built (Ep. 2379. ⁵2) temple of Jupiter
Capitolinus; from the Esquiline, the
temple of Vesta3 and the temple
(perhaps) of Jupiter Feretrius, on
the Capitoline. Thus illinc and iude
refer to the same spots.

ΕΡ. 373. (VII. lxxviii.)

He exposes the folly of Papilus, who, to appear grand, starved himself

Cum Saxetani ponatur cauda lacerti
Et, bene si cenas, conchis inuncta tibi:
Sumen, aprum, leporem, boletos, ostrea, mullos
Mittis: habes nee cor, Papsse, nee genium.

l. Samium] From Sex (Scxe Ρ).
a town of Baetica. in Spain.-For
the lacertas, cf. 545. ll; (317. 73

tenuemque lace1·tum.' It was a fish,
not held in great estimation.

2.] ⁴ If you want to dine well, you
have a little oil with your beans)
Some take inuncta to mean ⁴ without
oil;' but this would be his ordi-

nary ‹linnen-For conchis, see Ep.
245. 10.

3. Sumen] Quasi suffimen, ae
aymen for affinoen, &c.‚ the paps of
a pig that had just farrowed.
