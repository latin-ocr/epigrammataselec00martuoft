M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Praeteritosque dies et totos respicit annos.
Nee metuit Lethes iam propioris aquas.

Nulla recordanti lux est ingrata gravisque · 5
Nulla fuit, euius non meminisse velit.

Ampliat aetatis spatium sibi vir bonus: hoe est
Vivere bis, vita posse priore frui.

3. respicit] He looks back upon,
nkes a review of, his whole life,
:ind finds nothing to make him sear
death.

5. Nulla, &c.] Compare the
beautiful remark of Jason in Pind.
Pyth. iv. 104, εἴκοσι δ’ ἐκτελέσαις

ὶνιαυτούς οὔτε ἔργον οὔτ’ ἔπος

εὐτράπελον (Le. δόλιον) κείνοισιν
εἰπὼν ἱκόμαν οἴκαδε.

7. Ampliat] Auget, extendit. Hor.
Sat. i. 4. 32, ‘ ne quid summa de-
perdat metuens, aut ampliet ut rem?

The word is more common in the
later Latinity. Cf. Ep. 434. ll.

ΕΡ. 526. (X. xxiv.)

The poet moralizes on the fifty-seventh anniversary of his birthday‚

the lst of March. See Ep. 578* lo.

Natales mihi Martiae Kalendae,

Lux formosior omnibus Kalendis,

Qua mittunt mihi munus et puellae,

Quinquagesima liba septimamque

Vestris addimus hano focis acerram. 5

His voe, si tamen expedit,

roganti

Annos addite bis precor novenos,
Ut nondum nimia piger senecta,
Sed vitae tribus areis peractis

3. et puellae] On this day the
men sent presents to the women
(see Epp. 272. 10; 497. l5); but
Martial says he is such a general
favourite, that even the latter send
him presents, viz. birthday pre-
senta⁷ which in fact were distinet
from the ⁵ new year's gifts?

4. liba] See Ep. 1515. 3. Au offer-
ing of a cake and incense (acerra
thuris, Hor. Carm. iii. 8. 2) to the
genius was part of the birthday
ceremonies. The construction is
mther singular for ⁴ septima et quin-
quagesima liba cum acerra.'— Vestris
—fhcis, on the hearth or altar spe-
cially prepared for the birthday

festivities.

6. si tamen mpedit] ‘ Provided,
however. that it is to my interest,'
viz. to live so much longer. Many
persons (says Persius, iii. 5) make
foolish vows in the temples, tacita
αενννα. The poet makes the ful-
filment of his prayer conditional.
Cf. Plato, Phaedr. p. ⁸257, B, συν-
εὔχομαί σοι, ὦ Σώκρατες, εἴπερ
ἄμεινον ταῦθ’ ἡμῖν εἶναι, ταῦτα ’γί-
’γνεσθαι.-Ιιὶε-7ῑυ1·ε’7ιοε, l8†57=75.
This term he calls ⁸ the three periodo
of life) the metaphor being taken
from the courses in the Cirms, viz.
boyhood, maamad, and the tum of
life. Cf. Ep. 547,8.
