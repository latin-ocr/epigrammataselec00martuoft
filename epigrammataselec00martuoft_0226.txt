‘200 M. VAL. MARTIALIS

ΕΡ. 317. (VI. lxxxii.)

A jocose petition to a wealthy friend for the present of a new lacerna.

Quidam me modo, Rufe, diligenter

Inspectum, velut emptor aut lanista,

Cum voltu digitoque subuotasset,

‘⁶ Tune es, tune '’ ait “ille Martialis,

Cuius nequitias iocosque novit, ὅ
Aurem qui modo non habet Boeotam ?’'

Subrisi modice, levique nutu

Me quem dixerat esse non negavi.

“Cur ergo ’' inquit “habes malas lacernas ?''
Respondi, quia sum malus poeta. 10
Hoc ne saepius aecidat poetae,

Mittas, Rufe, mihi bonas lacernas.
