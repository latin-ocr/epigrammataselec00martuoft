160 Μ. VAL. MARTIALIS

Quid cum fratre tibi, quid cuin Polluce molesto? 5
Non esset Pollux si tibi, Castor eras.

Unus cum sitis, duo, Calliodorc, sedetis.
Surge: σολοικισμὸν, Calliodore, facis.

Aut imitare genus Ledae—cum fratre sedere

Non potes: alternis, Calliodore, sede. lu

qui dicit, σῦκα μερίζει. ‘The man
who tells me to divide a knight's
census. is like the man who would
halve a fig.'

7. sedetis] viz. on the subsellia
of the equites. See on 248. 1.

8.] σολοικισμὸν, a solecism in
language, viz. ⁸ unus suiuus!

9. Aut imitare] ‘ Or else follow
the example of Leda's s=›ns‚' viz.
as Castor was six months iu Hades,
and six mouths in heaven, alter-
nately with his brother Pollux (Ep.
471. ῖς 548. ⁵2), so do you take it
in turns to play the eques by sitting
on the knights* benches.

Supremas tibi triciens in anno

Signanti tabulas, Charine, misi

Hyblaeis madidas thymis placentas.

Defecit miserere iam, Charine.

Signa rarius, aut semel fae illud, 5
Mentitur tua quod subinde tussis.

Excussi loculosque saeculumque.

Croeso divitior licet fuissem,

Iro pauperior forem, Charine,

Si conchem totiens meam comesses. 10

5. αιιι semel] Or die once for all,

desks, and my money-bag.' So

of the commonest food, so often (viz.
thirty times in the year) sent you
at my expense, would have ruincd
me.³ Juv. iii. 292, ‘cujus aceto,
cujus conche tu1nes.' xiv. 131,
‘alterius conchem aestivam cum
parte lace1·ti.' lnf. lib. xiii. 7, ‘Si

testa, Lautorum cenis saepe negare
potes.'
