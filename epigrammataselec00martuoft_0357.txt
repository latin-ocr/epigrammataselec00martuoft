book (which though not les rned
enough for him, and by no means
very lig id in its morais still has
soniething of retincd wit) to my
eloquent friend Pliny? —72072 nimis

5. ›Sidam-ae] Pliny s hou: e was 011
the Esquiline hill ( domum meam
Esquiliisss Ep. iii. 21), and the sub-
ιινιι lay just at the foot of that hill.
The sense therefoie⁴ is ‘it is no gxi-eat
toil to ascend the high path of the
subura when you have passed through
it] i. e. it only remains to mount the

hill.

G. Illic, &eff This is a difficult
passage The sense seems to be as
soon as 1011 haxe as cended the Es-
quiline, you will get a sight of 1110

gyliich was in the vulley between the

squiline and the Palatino). made
slimv with the saffrori-water thrown

upmi it: cf. Ep. 464. 5, ‘lubrica

Corycio quamvis sint pulpita nimbo?
How the Colosseum was finished
above we do not seem to know3 but
it would appear to have been sur-
mounted with a sculptured group in
the way of an αἶέτωμα. To refer illic
to the roof of Pliny's house, involves
usin still greater difficulties, though
the smaller eagle on Pedo's house
might seem to be directly contrasted
with it. and to be mentioned as a
mark for distinguishing one domus
from the other.

10. tui—Pedonis] Pedo Albino-
vanus,‚ the celebrated writer of epi-
grams, is meant. See Ep. 102. 5.
As he was a wit, like Martial, he is
described as a votary of the Muse.
So Ep. 044. l, ‘ Parthenio dic, Musa,
tuost—minore pinna, an eagle of a
lesser size. The eagle, it would seem
from this, was a necessary part of the
αἱέτωμα (Pind. Ol. xiii. 21), though
combined with other figures. Tac.
Hist. iii. 71, ‘ mox sustinentes fasti-
gium aquilae vetere ligno traxerunt
flammam alueruntque.'
