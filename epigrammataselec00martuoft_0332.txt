M. VAL. MA RTIALIS

Ipse licet videas, cavea stabulantur in una
Et pariter socias carpit uterque dapes:
Nec fetu nemorum gaudent nec mitibus herbis, 5
Concordem satiat sed rudis agna famem.
Quid meruit terror Nemees, quid proditor Helles,
Ut niteant celsi lucida signa poli?
Sidera si possent pecudesque feraeque mereri,
Hic aries astris, hie leo dignus erat. 10

3. cavea] A cage or dcn usually

that in which beas ts wele kept at
the amphitheame (lib. i. 48. 6)

gr 1;155 but they both seed together

(ne of them at least. If the thing
related be a fact. it ceitainly con-
stituted the chief wonder of the

that the poet himself was dcceivcd.

7. proditor Helles] The ram that

ΕΡ. 483. (ix. lxxii.)

To a celebmted pugihst, who had sent a present of eatables, as a sportula,
to the poet. Playing on the name Liber, he reminds him that some wine
would have been acceptable too. There is an epigram in viii. 77, addressed
to the same man, who appears to bc somewhat of a scnsualist and a bon

rit-ant.

Liber, Amyclaea frontem vittate corona,
Qui quatis Ausonia verbera Graia manu,
Clusa mihi texto cum prandia vimine mittas,
Cur comitata dapes nulla lagona venit?

Atqui digna tuo si nomine munera ferres,

Scis, puto, debuerint quae mihi dona dari.
