On the same subject as the last.

Invia Sarmaticis domini lorica sagittis
Et Martis Getico tergore fida magis,

Quam vel ad Aetolae securam cuspidis ictus
Texuit innumeri lubricus unguis apri:

Felix sorte tua, sacrum oui tangere peetus t
Fas erit et nostri mente calere dei.

I comes et magnos illaesa merere triumphos
Palmataeque duceni, sed cito, redde togae.

1. Invia] ‘Inipenetrable t0.' The
Sarmatiam, as Pausanias says (i.
ch. 21. 8), used bows and arrows of
cornel—wood, and were also fained
for a. kind of breast—plate, made of
overlapping plates of horn taken
from horscs' hoofs.

2 Martis ἃς. ] ‘ More trusty than
the shield ainud nith which Mars
is worshipped by the Getae —teryore‚
cf. Aen. i. 211.

3. Aetolm] Interwoven with
boars' hoofs, so stout, that even
Meleager's spear could not pierce
it.

generally t·2ken‘p01is'hed' Simi-
1aryl,in 11 x. ⁰03, the foraging-cap
worn by Ul) ¹sses was fenced outside
with rows ol boars‘ teeth.

5.] Feliae sorte ίιια seems to have
been a formula ofRoman blessing. lt
is used again in vii. 8. 5, ‘Happy
lorica, that will touch that breast,
and be warmed by that heart.'

8. Palmalae —toycoe] sc. tri-
umphali. There seems to be a

confusion between the ‘ toga picta'
and-³ tunica palmata' her.e 1⁴ estus
says that the latter w as originally so
called from 112v1ng a latus clavus
one palm br0ad; afterw'alds, when
it was :¹2d01ned nith palm· bmnehes,
the naine was referred to tlicm3 it
xx as used by generals in triumphs,
by the pl iet01 presiding at pthfl
games, in the transvectio equitum,
and was given to distinguished men.
So Livyf’xxx. 15, Masinissam Sei io
aurea corona, aurea patera, se 15
curuli et scipione eburneo, toga
picta et tunic-22 palmata donat, addit
—neque magnificentius quicquan)
triumpho apud Romanos neque tria
umphantibus ampliorem eo ornatu
esse.q Tac. Ann i. 15, ‘Decreta
pecunia ex aerario utque per Circum
triumphali veste ute1¹entur.' The
same dress is meant by the ‘ tunica
Jovis' and 'pivtw Sarrana—aulaea
togae‚' Juv. x. 38. The ‘picta
toga' was probably identical with
the ⁸ t1·abea,' Propert. v. 4. 53.-sed
cito, ‘and that soon?
