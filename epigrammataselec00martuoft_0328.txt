ΕΡ 478. (IX. ixi)

This also' is a most elegant and highly poetical composition. It describes
a plane- tiffee some years pxeviously planted at Coi-deva by the hand of
Domitian. It appears to have stood in the viridarium, in the peris tyle
οι· inner court of a town -mansion (domus).

In Tartessiacis domus est notissima terris,
Qua dives placidum Corduba Baetin amat,
Vellera nativo pallent ubi flava metallo
Et linit Hesperium bractea viva pecus 3
Aedibus in mediis totos amplexa penates 5
Stat platanus densis Caesariana comis,
Hospitis invicti posuit quam dextera feIiX,
Coepit et ex illa crescere virga manu.
Auctorem dominumque suum sentire videtur:

Sic viret et ramis sidera celsa petit.

Saepe sub hac madidi luserunt arbore Fauni
Terruit et tacitam fistula sera domum ;
