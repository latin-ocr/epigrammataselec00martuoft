EPIGRAMMATA. 109

where his reverence for virgil is mentioned, whose close imitator he
was.

Sili, Castalidum decus sororum,

Qui periuria barbari furoris

Ingenti premis ore perfidosque

Astus Hannibalis levesque Poenos

Magnis cedere cogis Africanis: 5
Paulum seposita severitate,

Dum blanda vagus alea December
Incertis sonat hinc et hinc fritillis
Et ludit tropa nequiore talo,
Nostris otia commoda Camenis,
Nec torva lege fronte, sed remissa
Lascivis madidos iocis libellos.

Sic forsan tener ausus est Catullus
Magno mittere passerem Maroni.

2. qui, &c.] ι111110 111 powerful
strains are suppl-essing (i.e. de-
sei-ibing the defeat of) the perjuries
of barbaric rago, and compelling
the perfidious arts of Hannibal and
the fickle Carthaginians to submit
to the great Africani.'—pc›jztria‚
Cf. Ep. 286. 6.

5. costis] i.e. ‘canis quemadmo-
dum exacti fuerint? Cf. Hor. Sat.
i. x. 38, ‘ Tui-gidus Alpinus jugulat
(111111 Memnona.' ii. 5. 41, ⁴ Furius
hibernas cana nive conspuit Alpes 3¹
for Furius Bibaculus had begun a
poem with ⁴ Juppiter hibernas}

6. severitate] i. e. ‘ severo operef

7. dum, δια] During the Sa-
turnulia⁷ at which time only it was
allowed to play with ⁶ vetit&⁴ legibus
alea! Cf. Ep. 593 and 272.

9. nequiore talo] The tulus ap-
pears to have been thrown from the
hand, not from the box (⁴ fritillas,
turricula, py1·gus‚' or ‘ phimus ²), and
therefore affin-ded more scope for
cheating. This explains mcertis
also, ‘hazardous3' for with the
‘fritilli' you could not be so cer-

tain of what you were going to
throw, as if you threw from the
hand. Cf. xiv. 16, ‘ Quae scit com-
ositos manus improba mittere ta-
los, Si per me misit, nil nisi vota
facit.¹ i.c. he can never make sure,
but has to trust to fortune. Hence
also Ep. 199. 15, ‘supposita est
blancio nunquam tibi tessera talo.'
—sonat‚ from the rattling noise.
In Ep. 272. 3, the player is ⁸ blando
male proditus fritillos-tropa is a
very uncertain reading. It seems
to mean ‘the t1·ickste1·,' οι· ‘gam-
blm-‚³ For the whole subject of the
‘tali' and ‘tesserae,’ cf. Becker's
Gallus, Sc. x. Excursus ii.

12. madidos] ‘Steeped in wanton
jokes.' The excuse for a grave
poet reading them is the licenee of
the season.

13. sic J‘brsan] Martial compares
himself 1ο Catullus, Silius to virgil.
In the same spirit as Catullus might
have sent his poem about his 11113·
tress's pet sparrow (cf. Cat. iii.) to
VirSgill, so he humbly sends his poema
to iius.
