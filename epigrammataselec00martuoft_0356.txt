Macer, who had been appointed surveyor for the paving of the Appian
Way, had written to M artial, to ask for his book as a present at the Satur-
nalia (Ep. 690. 4). The poet replieS, that the road will suffer if the
epigrama be taken up instead of books 011 engineeiing.

Saturnalicio Macrum fraudare tributo,
Frustra, Musa, cupis: non licet, ipse‘petit:
Sollemnesque ioeos nee tristia carmina poscit
Et queritur nugas obticuisse meas.
Mensorum longis sed nune vacat ille libellis. 5

Eheu! quam fatuae sunt tibi, Roma, togae!

2. IVec spondet] ‘ He will not give
security, nor lend money himself,
nor indeed has he any thing to give,
even if he were willing.' Cf. Pers.
v. 79, ⁴ Marco spondente. recusas

3. curet] Colat, θεραπεύῃ-πενί-

‘what fools are Roman clients‚' who
were called togati.
