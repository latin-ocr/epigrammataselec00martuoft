M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Quid, quod securo potat conviva ministro,
Et casum tremulae non timuere manus?
Hoc quoque non nihil est, quod propinabis in istis,

Frangendus fuerit si tibi, Flaeee‚ calix.

scratched upon it, as in Ep. 186. 16,
⁸ Hispanae luteum rotae toreuma,'
and xiv. 94, quoted above.

7. Quid, quod] ‘ Nay, they have
this further advantage, that the guest
can use them without causing anxiety
to the attendant (i. e. lest he should
let tho cup sall, or steal genis from it,
JuV. v. 40), and that there is so much
the less chance of breaking them, be-

10

cause the hand ‹loes not tremble lest
it should break them.'

9. Hoc quoque] There is yet an-
other advantage: ⁴ if you have to
‹lrink the health of some nasty fel-
low, whose lips must touch the cup,
you won’t mind doing 50, because
you can break it afte1·wards.' JuV.
v. 127, ‘ quando propinat Virro tibi,
sumitve tuis contacta labellis pocula?

ΕΡ. 679. (XII. lxxvi.)

On the great cheapness of provisions, which, of course, the poet describes

hyperbolically.

Amphora vicenis, modius datur aere quaterno.
Ebiius et crudus nil habet agricola.

l. vicenis] i. e. nummis. ‘An
amphora of wine is only worth
twenty sestertii, a bushel of corn
only worth four assesf—aes qualer-
mcm. ⁶ four coppers each.' Cic. Pro
Font. ξ 5, ‘quaternos denarios in
singulas vini amphoras exegisse!

2. Ebrius et crudus] ⁴ The farmer

drinks till he is tipsy, and eats till
hc gets a fitof indigestion, aud has
nothing.' He seems to mean that
the farmer prefers to consume the
produce he cannot sell at a remune-
rative price. For crudus see Ep.

ΕΡ. 680. (ΧΠ. lxxviii.)

Nil in te scripsi, Bithynice.
Malo satisfacere.

Et iurare iubes?

2. jurare. ἔξω] Me nil in te scrip<
sisse. ⁴ Ratlmr than do that' (says
the poet, who is willing to admit the
charge), ⁴ I would make you some
amends,' i. e. by apology or a money

Credere non vis,

payment. The joke consists in un-
willingness to deny what he thinks
a credit to him rather than the con-
trary.

EP. 681. (XII. lxxxi.)

On a patron who grew more stingy as he grew richer. A witty epigram
'Phia is probably the Umber of Ep. 361.
