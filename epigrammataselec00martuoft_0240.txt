M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Quem meus intravit splendenti cuspide Dexter,
Praeda iacet nostris invidiosa focis.

Pinguescant madidi laeto nidore penates 5
Flagret et exciso festa eulina iugo.

Sed cocus ingentem piperis consumet acervum
Addet et arcano mixta Falerna garo.

Ad dominum redeas, noster te non capit ignis,

Conturbator aper: vilius esurio.

by Statius, Sylv. iv. 6. 10, as better
than the Umbriau, ‘Tuscus apel·
generosior Umb1·o.' See Ep. 645. 9.

2] Only second to the Aetolian
boar, killed by Meleager. Cf 4158. ὃς
lib. xiii. 93, ‘Qui Diomedeis me-
tuendus setiger agris Aetola cecidit
cuspide, talis c1·at.' For ‘sccundus'
with a dative, see 338. 23 Aen. xi.

4. invidiosa] ‘Invidiam movens
foco utnon satis amplo.'

5. Pinyzu‘scant, διο] ‘Let the
steaming kitchen fatten on the
pleasant smell, and the festive
ucarth blazc with whole woods cut
from the hill-top3 but then the cook
will use up great heaps of pepper,
and un'x Falernian with the choicest
kind of sauce. (This is too much for
my means.) Return to your master
your ruinous boar: my hunger is
sansfled at a suialler outla)·.'—ma-

didi, opposed to sicci, and meaning
‘well supplied with moistu1·c.' as
oil. sauces, &c. So Propert. V. 4. 76,
‘lcum' pagana madent fercula de-
icus.

8. arcano] Stored up, as the best
ἷνοέιῖᾱ be, Ep. 476. 5. -9ανο, cf.

lO. Conturbator] That will make
me bankrupt (cf. Ep. 581. 9); for
a man in difficulties was said ‘ con-
turbare rationes' Cf. Ep. 446. 5.
Juv. 7. 126, ‘Sic Pedo conturbat,
Matho deficit3' 14. 94, ‘Totam hanc
turbavit filius amens.' But there is
an allusion to the turning up of the
soil by the boar's snout, which the
Greeks expressed by τυμβάζειν, the
Romans by turbare-vilius, &Q it
costs me less to starve at home, i. e.
to fare poorly and cheaply, than to

accept a present involving so mut-li
eost. Cf. 269. 2.

ΕΡ. 342. (VII. xxviii.)

Martial sends his book to Fuscus, asking him to read it during his
leisure time at the Saturnalia, and write a critique on it3 probably the

Fuscus of Juv. xvi. 46.

Sic Tiburtinae crescat tibi silva Dianae
Et properet caesum saepe redire nemus,
Nee Tartessiacis Pallas tua, Fusce, trapetis
Cedat et immodici dent bona musta laeus;

l. Tiburtinae] there Fuscus had
a country seat.

3. Pallas lua] sc. ‘olivetum
tuum.' ‘ Palladis arb0r,' Ep. 37. 7.
-Tartessiacis, of Spain. Cf. Stat.

Sylv. ii. 7. 28, ‘Quae Tritonide
fertiles Athenas tinctis, Baetica,
provocas trapetis.'-1rapelis‚ ‘ millu
—l‹1czcs, cf. Ep. 184. 2.
