Marcus amat nostras Antonius, Attice, Musas,
Charta salutatrix si modo vera refert:
Marcus Palladiae non inficianda Tolosae
Gloria, quem genuit pacis alumna quies.
Tu, qui longa potes dispendia ferre viarum, 5
I, liber, absentis pignus amicitiae.
Vilis eras, fateor, si te nunc mitteret emptor:
Grande tui pretium muneris auctor erit.
Multum, crede mihi, refert, a fonte bibatur

Quae fluit, an pigro quae stupet unda lacu.

2. salutatrioe] A friendly note from
Antonius to Mar‚tial askihg after his

7. emptor] ⁶ One who had bought

see Ep. 692. ‘ The value of the gift,'
he adds, ‘will be its author,' viz. the
fact of its being sent hythe author
himself, and probably with his cor-
rections. Comp. Ep. 333. 7, 8.

9. llJultum refrrt, bibatur unda
qztaefluit ascune, an quae stupet, &c.]
It makes all the difference whether
water is druuk fresh from the source
or after having long been exposed in
a sluggish pool. Just so a poem has
more zest from the hands of the
author than after l3ing open to the
gaze oi* the many in a booksellcrs
shop.
