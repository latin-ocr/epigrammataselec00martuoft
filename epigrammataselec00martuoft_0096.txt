Non suut longa quibus nihil est quod demere possis,
Sed tu, Cosconi, disticha longa facis.

ΕΡ. 103. (ΙΙ. lxxxi.)

Laxior hexaphoris tua sit lectica licebit:
Cum tamon haec tua sit, Zoile, sandapila est.

l. leuior] ‘More roomy.' “The
lecticw: '' (a kind of palanquin)
“were borne by scwer or more
slaves, according as they varied in
size. An itzyens lemma required
six or eight lecticarii, and was called
hemaphoron or octoplmron ‘¹' (Becker,
Gallus, p. 344).—s‹md‹cpila est, “the
rich were carried ont to burial on a

lectus or lectica funeb1-is; the poor
in a coffin (sandapila).” Mayor
on Juv. viii. 175. The sense is,
that Zoilus is such a wmthless
fellow, α’γῆς ἄλλως ἄχθος, and as
it were a mere vile cadaver (Ep.
439. 9), that his fine lectica becomes
a pauper's sandapila by the mere
fact of containing him.

3. dona quod, ἃς] ⁴ If you com-
plain that Ι have sent you in the

cold season a present more fitted for
summer, you niay retort by sending
me, though more fitfor summer wear,
a toga with short, well-clipped nap.'
The rasa toga was op osed to pera,
which had long si ky nap, Ep.
