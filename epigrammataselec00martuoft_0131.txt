Longa, precor, Pylioque veni numerosior aevo
Semper et hoc voltu vel meliore nite.

Hie colat Albano Tritonida multus in auro 5
Perque manus tantas plurima quereus eat;

Hie eolat ingenti redeuntia saecula lustro
Et quae Romuleus saera Tarentos habet.

Magna quidem, Superi, petimus, sed debita terris:

Pro tanto quae sunt improba vota deo?

3. Pylio aevo] ‘ Counted in larger
numbers than the age of Nestor?

4.] ‘ May he (Domitian) for
many years crowned with gold sa-
crifice to Minerva on the Alban
Hill, and bestow many an oak gar-
land with his powerful hands! May
he keep the “ludi saeculares? as
they return in their great lustrum,
and the sacrifices performed in the
Terentus.³

5. Albano] Cf. Suet. Dom. 4,
‘celebrabat in Albano quotannis
Quinquatria Minervae, cui collegium
instituerat.' Mart. xi. 7. 3, ⁶ Caesar
in Albanum jussit me mane venire.'
Ep. 215. l. Statsilv. iv. 2. (32, ‘Saepe
coronatis iteres Quinquennia lustris
-Trojanae qualis sub collibus Albae
—Palladio tua me manus induit
aur0.' Suetonius also says that
‘Minervam relligiose colebat? Cf.
also Ep. 44⁴3. lst-in (zm-(1, Suet.
Dom. 4, ‘Capite gestans coronam
auream cum effigie Jovis ae Junonis
Minervaeque ;' or, mullas in <mro
may mean, occupied in distributing
golden crowns (se. to the winners) 3
or, lastly, multus in Albam, (mro
may be rendered, ‘devoted to the
worship of the golden statue at Alba.q
Tacitus speaks of‘ aureum Minervae
simula(:1·um,' set up in the curia in
honour of Nero, Ann. xiv. 12.

6. quercus] Qucrca corona, given
to the victors in the gamos instituted
in honour of Jupiter Capitolinus,
Ep. 191. l. Suet. Dom. iv., ‘In-
stituit quinquennale eertamen Ca-
pitolino Jovi triplex musicum,
equestre gymnicum et aliquanto
plurium quam nunc e=t corona-
rum.' Perhaps, however, the allusion

lo

is to the oak-garland, hung up at
the palace. Ep. 444. 7. Ovid, lsast.
i. [314.

7. ingenti, &c.] The Ludi saecu-
lares recurring every 100 years, he
may well say, v. 7, ‘ Magna quidem
petimus.' Cf. Suet. Dom. 4, ‘Fecit
,udos saeculares computata ratione
temporum ab anno non quo Claudius
proxime, sed olim Augustus edide-
rat ς’ and compare Tac. Anu. xi. ll.
The proelamation usual before these
games was ‘venite ad ludos spec-
tandos quos nec spectavit quisquam
nec spectaturus ests Claud. 21. Thc
inssens lustrum (μέγας ἐνιαυτὸς) is
the term of 111) yearS, adopted by
Augustus in his eomputation. ln
the time of the repul›lic these were
called ludi Tarentini or Taurii.
They are said to have been insti-
tund by one Valerius, whose three
children, when attacked by a plague,
were saved by drinking water
warmed at a place in the Campus
Martius, called Tarenlzmm others
connect it with the battle of the
Horatii and Curiatii. The name
‘Tarentus' is said to be connected
with Tarquinius, and the place
itself to have been the site of Tar-
quinius Superbus' house at Rome.
For Tarentos, cf. Ep. 333 x. 63. 3,
‘ liis mea Romano spectata est vita
Tarento' (sc. at the seculares of
Claudius and Domitian). The ritcs
performed at this place were of
a mystic nature, to the infernal
powers, and they uere celebrated
at long intervals. Varm, L. L. vi.
ἰαί, says it took place in the Vela-

rum.
