cn o p ate.

Mille tibi nummos hesterna luce roganti
In sex aut septem, Caeciliano, dies,

“ Non habeo'' dixi: sed tu causatus amici
Adventum lancem paucaque vasa rogas

Stultus es? an stultum me eredis, amice? negavi 5

On a boy killed by the fall of an icicle on his throat. There is a
similar argument to Ep. iii. Anthol. Graec„ in which the death of a
Thracian boy is reconntcd, who breaking through whilst sliding on the

Qua vicina pluit Vipsanis porta columnis
Et madet assiduo lubricus imbre lapis,
In iugulum pueri, qui roseida tecta subibat,
Deeidjt hiberno praegravis unda gelu:
Cumque peregisset miseri crudelia fata, 5
Tabuit in calido vulnere mucro tener.
Quid non saeva sibi voluit Fortuna licere?
Aut ubi non mors est, si iugulatis aquae?

ΕΡ. 168. (IV. xix.)

Martia] sends to a friend an ‘emh-omiss the usefulness of which he
praises highly, if not its elegante. Becker says of the ‘ endromis‚' Gallus,
p. 422, “The endromis was not a garment, but a thick piece of eloth,
forming a coverlet, which was thrown round the body after gymnastic
exercises‚ to prevent cold being taken. ln the. same way Trimalchio,
in Petron. 28, after the bath, covers himself with a coccina 9ausapa.”
