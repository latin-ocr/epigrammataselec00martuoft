M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Et sis invidia favente felix, 5
Sic Burrus cito sentiat parentem:

Admittas timidam brevemque chartam

Intra limina sanctioris aevi.

Nosti tempora tu Iovis sereni,

Cum fulget placido suoque voltu, 10
Quo nil supplicibus solct negare.

Non est quod metuas preces iniquas:

Nunquam grandia nec molesta poscit

Quae cedro decorata purpuraque

Nigris pagina crevit umbilicis. 15
Nec porrexeris ista, sed teneto

Sic tanquam nihil offeras agesque.

Si novi dominum novem sororum,

Ultro purpureum petet libellum.

5. invidiasavente] The malignant
goddess herself not only sparingyou,
but favouring you. So Proper-t. iii.
8. 11, ‘ quem modo felicem invidia
admirante ferebant.'

6. Burrus] Parthenius' son. Ep.
185.—-senliut parentem, ‘have the
sentiments of his father.' Cf. Pers.
1, ‘cum sapimus patruos ς’ or,
‘ be aware of his father's fame ς’ as
Ep. 294. 4, ⁴ etpatrias laudes sentiat
esse suas.'

8. aevi] If this reading (al. aulae)
be right, it seems to mean, a court
of the old school, where moral
fashions and habits prevail. It is
a compliment to Domitian as
censor. So Ep. 3353. 3, ⁴ inter car-
uiina sanctiora siquis Lascivae fuerit
locus Thaliae?

9. tempora—Jews] The proper
seasons for offering the gift to Do-
mitian, viz. at the dinner honr.—
cum falyet. ‘when he beams with
his own kindly rounten2.nce.' Ep.
269. 24, ‘ et voltu placidus tuo

recumbes.'

12. preces iniquas] An unreason-
able request3 sear not that it is a
petition which is to be presented
under the guise osa. book.

13. grandia] A book expensively
got up, and splendidly bound, is
not like an ordinary petition.--
cedro, &c., see Ep. 110. 7.

16. teneto] Do not officiously
hold it out (like a petition), and so
thrust it on the emperor, but hold
it merely ready to give it if he asks
for it. which, says the poet, l think
he will do. Compare Hor. Epist.

18. Si novi, δια] “ Ifl know arigh
the Lord of the nine Muses* (i.e
Domitian, who is himself a poet),
‘hc will ask of his own accord for
a book that he sees in a purple
envelope‚' viz. such having been
sent before, and as having a very
different appearance from a libellus
in the sense of ⁸ a petition.'

ΕΡ. 218. (v. vii.)

On the restoration of the buildings in Rome, especially the Capitol, that
had been bumed in the Vitellian insurrection.
