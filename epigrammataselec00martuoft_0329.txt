his revels under the tree, so that
the whole house was fragrant with
wine ; nay, the tree itself grew more
blithely from the wine poured out
in libations on its 1·oots.' It was
the custom‚ as appears from Propert.
v. 8. 35, to hold drinking parties in
the 2·iridari1mz; ‘ unus erat tribus
in secreta lectulus umbra! The
libations were not, perhaps, specially
to the tree, though they may have
moistened the ground under it.

yesterday's wreaths lay around it

in such confusion, that no one could

ΕΡ. 479. (IX. lxiv.)

On a temple and statue of Hercules, consecrated by Domitian at the
eighth milestone on the Appian way (inf. Ep. 505), and the sixth from
Alba (ibid. 12). It would seem, from the context, that a new statue of
the emperor had been substituted for an old one of Hercules. So Ep.

p. 378.

Sec Merivale, Hist. vii.

Herculis in magni voltus descendere Caesar
Dignatus Latiae dat nova templa viae,

l. descendere] It is a condescen-
sion on the partos thc emperor to
assume the form of Hercules, viz.
in a statue. In the same spirit of
flattery the real Hercules is called
pusillus, in Ep. 141. 4, as compared
with the pretender to the name.—
Laliae riae. The via Latina led

straight to Aricia, which is called
in the next verse the ‘woody do—
main' of Trivia, or Diana, because
she was worshipped at the Lacus
Nemorensis. near that place, in com-
mon with Hippolytus, or Virbius.
