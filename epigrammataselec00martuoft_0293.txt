EPIGRAMMATA. 267

ΕΡ. 430. (vm. iix.)

On a one-eyed thief, whose single luminary sei-ved him as well as two
would serve other people. Cf. Ar. Plut. 065, εἷς μέν ’γε Νεοκλείδης, ὅς
ἐστι μὲν τυφλὸς, κλέπτων δὲ τοὺς βλέποντας ὑπερηκόντικε.

Aspicis hunc uno contentum lumine, cuius
Lippa sub attrita fronte lacuna patet?

Ne contemne caput, nihil est furacius illo;
Non fnit Autolyci tam piperata manus.

Hunc tu convivam cautus servare memento: 5
Tunc furit atque oculo luscus utroque videt.

Pocula solliciti perdunt ligulasque ministri

Et latet in tepido plurima mappa sinu.
Lapsa nec a cubito subducere pallia nescit

Et tectus laenis saepe duabus abit.

10

Nec dormitantem vernam fraudare lucerna
Erubuit fallax, ardeat illa licet.

Si nihil invasit, puerum tune arte dolosa
Circuit et soleas surripit ipse suas.

l. contentum] ‘ Who has only one
eye to boast of, and bencath whose
hardened (unblushing) brow a bleary
socket ἔλυες]

2. attrita] Impudent. Cf. Jnv.
13. 242, ‘ Ejectum semel attrita de
fronte 1·ubore1n.' So ‘perfricuit
f1·ontem‚' xi. 27. 7. The idea seems
to be of rubbing the face so smooth,
that shame could not cling to it.

3. Ne contemne] μὴ μέμψῃ, ‘don't
‹lispai·age‚' or think lightly of, ‘that
head ς a greater thiefthan the wear-er
of it (locs not exist: Autolycus him-
self had not such a spicy hand.’
Autolycus was a son of Hermes. and
the grandfather of Ulysses. Hc was
famous as a kind of typieal thief.
Cf. Plaut. Bacchid. 275, ‘Deceptus
sumg Autolyco hospiti aurum cre-
didis—piperum, pungent, peppery,
ὀξίνης. Petron. Sat. 44, ‘ tunc ha.-

hitnbat ad arcum veterem, me puero,
piper, non homo: is quacunque ibat,
terram adurebat)

5.] serrare = observare. So Virg.
Aen. 6. 338, ‘ Palinurus—dum sidera
servat.'

17. Ιὶῃτιῖαε] Dessert-spoons. See
4 0. 225.

8. mappa] Eaeh guest brought his
own apparently. Cf. Ep. 655. 11,

,(1. α cubito lapsa] ‘The mantle
that has slipped froin a neighbour's
elbow while reclining on the lectus,
he contrives to transfer to his own
back, and so goes away with two.’
Of course this is 1111 hyperbole.

lta] If he has found nothing· to
steai, he eircumvents his slave with
crafty skill, and steals from him his
own shoes. These were taken off at
a banquet, and given to the slavo

to keep. Cf. Ep. 143. 3: 683. 1.
