x TO THE READER.

The edition of Martia} by Lemaire (Paris, 1825), in three
vols. octavo, has boen consulted throughout 3 but it does
not eontain very much more than the ⁶ Variorum’ editions,
of which I have chiefly used that by Schrevelius, a sound
and learned work, and hitherto almost the only one With
notes available sor ordinary studente, though first pub·
lished as long ago as 1656.
