Si iubeat patria damnatum excedere terra,
Per freta, per scopulos exulis ibo comes.

Das partem? “Multum est.’' Candide, das aliquid?
Mecum eris ergo miser: quod si deus ore sereno

Annuerit, felix, Candide, solus eris.

5. dat tihi, ἃς] ⁴ But fortune has
not given you such ill luck, on the
contrary, she has given you wealth.
Now, am Ι to share in the good,
as I was willing to share 111 the
evil? You make all kinds of
excusas-ecquid stant, ἂψ, ‘ You
ask, is this property of yours (ista)
the property of two Ρ ’ 1. e. how can
you put in a claim sor a share?
This is said 111 reference to the

favoni-ite say-ing: of Candidus (Ep.
87), κοινὰ φιλων.-([αε partem,
‘ well, do you give me any portion

you will bc with nie (or share your
fortuncs with mc) when badly off:
but if the god kindly assents to your
prayers, you will keep your pros-

On the captator Selius (Ep. 70).

Laudantem Selium cenae cum retia tendit,
Accipe, sivo legas, sive patronus agas:
“Effectel graviter! cito! nequiter! euge! beatel”

Hoc volui.

2. accipe] παραλάμβανε, ‘take
him with you, and accept his pro-
osed services to applaud' (Pliny,
{Epist ii. l4).-cenae, *when he
lays his suares to catch a dinner.'

3. nequiter, as we should say of a
well-pointed satire, ‘ that's too bad,¹

Facta est iam tibi cena, tace.

or ‘a hard hit, that? On the
praises ofinterestcd friends on these
occasions, see Pers. i. 49. 84. 87.
These are spe‹·i1ncns of the languagc
Selius was wont to use on such
occasions—hoc volni, ⁶ thank you!
That's just what I wanted. You
have earncd your dinner, and now—
hold your tongue.' He does not
want his conversation, and only
invites him because he must.
