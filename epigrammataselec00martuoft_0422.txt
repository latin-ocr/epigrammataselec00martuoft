Μ. VAL. MARTIALIS

At tu consilio videaris ut usus amici,
Sic morere, ut factum te putet esse patrem.

7. amici] ‘That you may seem
to have followed the advice of your
friend Lupus. which he never incant
you to take, die without leaving him
any thing‚' make such a will as

ΕΡ. 621.

would beflt a father, who prefers to
make his children his heim-putet,
viz. even if the case is not really so,
and you are still orbus. Perhaps he
recommends adoptio.

(XI. lvi.)

He ridicules the avowed willingncss of a stoic philosopher to leave this
life, on the ground that he possessos nothing worth living for. Life to you,

says Martial. is no sacrifice at all.

But Martial did not understand a

motive‚ which in all ageS. at least from Socrates downwards, has actuated
good nien, viz. to wean themselves from a love. of life by voluntary

poverty.

Quod nimium mortem, Chaeremon Stoice, laudas,
Vis animum mirer suspiciamque tuum.
Hanc tibi virtutem fracta facit urceus ansa
Et tristis nullo qui tepet igne focus,
Et teges et cimex et nudi sponda grabati, 5
Et brevis atque eadem nocte dieque toga.
Ο quam magnus homo es, qui faece rubentis aceti
Et stipula et nigro pane carere potes!
Leuconicis agedum tumeat tibi culcita lanis

Constringatque tuos purpura pexa toros:

2. suspiciam] Θαυμάζω, look up
to.
3. urceus] A vessel of common
crock, with a handle. as appears
from this and xiv. 106, ‘hic tibi
donatur panda ruber urceus ansa.'
It was probably our ‘jugx¹ Rich
(Dict. in v.) says that we do not
know its precise form.

5. teges et cimeoe] ‘A mat with
bugs in it) The tesses was the beg-
gar's wrap, Juv. v. 8. Compare
Ep. 604. l, 2; ix. 92. 3, ‘dat tibi
securos vilis tegeticula somnos)—
sponda grabati. ‘the frame of a
truck-bed without a mattress on it'
(torus). The meaning of this is
well shown in the illustrations under

yrubalus and sponda, in Rich's Dic-
tionary. See Epp. 190. 53 657. ll.

7. rubentis aceti] Contemptuously
for rubri vini.

9. assedam] ‘Come now, suppose
your cushion to be stuffed with the
finest and softest floek. and the cover
of your matti-esses to be purple-(lyed
texture with long nap, would you
not wish to prolong life just in the
same degree as you now wish to
leave it Ρ ' The tormentum or stuffing
of the best kind was called Leuco-
nicam, perhaps from its whiteness.
So xi. ⁴21. 8, ⁶ culcita leuconico quod
viduata suo,' and xiV. 159. *Op-
pressae nimium vicina est fascia
plumae Ρ Vellera Leuconicis accipe
rasa sagiS.' — Constrinyat. ⁴ tightly
cover.'—On pera (applied to togas),
see Ep. 88. l.
