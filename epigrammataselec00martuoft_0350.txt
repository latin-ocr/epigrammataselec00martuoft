speaking in disparagement of ma-
trons or senators, whom it is his
duty to treat with all respect, has
wronged them by undutiful verse.'
By stola, the characteristic dress
(Rich's Dict. p. 6'21) of the matrons;
by purpura, the laticlave of the
senator is meant (Ep. 392. 4). Hence
impio refers to the unnatural or un-
dutiful abuse of the patres. Domi-

a more despised class, called νομα-
