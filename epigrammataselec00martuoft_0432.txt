but if you pretend not to know what
that means (i. e. that it is my way

Cf. Ep. 526. 14. ‘dissimulas ? facies
me, puto, causidicum?

(XII. iii.)

The poet addresses his book, i.e. the present book, and says that he
sends it to Rome from his native place (Bilbilis, in Spain), where it was
written, A.D. 102, in the reign of Trajan. In the letter to Priscus, pre—
fixed to this book, he speaks of having laid aside his pen for three ¹years
(trienni desidiae), from the little sympathy and encouragement which he

met with as an author in Spain.

Ad populos mitti qui nuper ab urbe solebas,
Ibis, io, Romam nunc peregrine liber,
Auriferi de gente Tagi tetricique Salonis,
Dat patrios manes quae mihi terra potens.
N on tamen hospes eris, nec iam potes advena diei, 5
Cuius habet fratres tot domus alta Remi.
Iure tuo veneranda, novi pete limina templi,
Reddita Pierio sunt ubi templa choro.

l. Ad populos] To the various
nations subject to Rome, and to the
provinces.

2. per-cyriae] For peregrinus. See
Ep. 34. 2, ‘ire juberis Ad Proculi
nitidos officiose lares.'

3. tetrici] Rough and wild, Ep.
522. 14; or perhaps, like its own
waters, which were believed to
harden iron, Ep. 25. 12. Inf. Ep.
(ι’-18. 9‚and 649. l, ⁶ rigidi Salonis?

4. patrios manes] Viz. ‘ majores

meos.' The precise sense in which
a land is said ‘dare Manes.' is not
clear. The earth, which had the

spirits of the dcparted in its keep-
ing. may be supposed to furnish οι·
supply them. as it were. for the pro-
tection of living members of the
same qens. But the meaning, per-
haps, is simply, ‘ dedit mihi parentes‚'
i. e. vitam.

6. fratres tot] As a person cannot

be regarded as wholly a stranger to
a city in which many of his brothers
and sistere have been bor'n, so a
book which follows so many others
written at Rome is not wholly of
Spanish origin3 it is imbued with
the spirit of Roman life—domus—
Remz‘, i. e. urbs Romana. There is
perhaps an allusion to the humilis
casa Romuli, to which the asta
domgs, on the Palatine‚ is op·
pose .

7. Jure tuo] Because approved
poets had a kind of right in the
Palatine library.—-n0vz'—templi‚ i. e.
restored by Nerva, who retained
the former dedication to Apollo and
the Muses, to whom the temple is
therefore said to have been restored.
Some have thought that a group of
statues of the Muses had been added.
