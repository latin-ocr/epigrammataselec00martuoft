xiv LIFE AND WRITINGS

sometimes given merely as a privilege), a tribuncship,
and the rights of equestrian rank ⁷, though he was not a
justus eques, i. e. had not thc full equestrian census So
popular had Martial's writings become at Romo, that hc
had many plagiarists and detractore to contend against,
of both of whom he often speaks with great bitte1·ncss⁸.
The usual way by which young poets at this time came
into notice, was by giving public recitations. We know
from ‘Juvenal (vii. 83) that Statius invited his friends to
a hearing, ‘promisitque dien]‚' when he had completed
his Thebais. That Martial did the same at first, is clear
from his complaint⁹ that the friends, who ostentatiously
copied down his epigrams at the time, by way of com-
pliment‚ did not show the same fondness for them after-
wards. It was in this way that plagiarists used to
appropriate the verses of others. This the poet charges
one Fidentinus with doing (i. 29) :—

‘ Fama refert nostros te, Fidentine, libellos
Non aliter populo quam recitare tuos.
Si inca vis dici, gratis tibi carmina mittam ς
Si diei tua vis, en, eme, ne mea sint?

And he not unfrequently ¹ jokes on selling] to plagiarists
verses of his own that have never been recited ; whereby
he shows up their impudence in appropriating those
which had. Of criticism he was, or affected to be, very
timid‚ and he often asks the patronage or friendly re-

Oceanus: i. e. 111 the fourteen ordines. The privilege of the jus trium
liberorum was this: a father of three children was free froin all per-
sonal taxes, and had a prior claim to all magisterial dignities and
remunerative posts in the adininistration3 and 111 such posts, for
which a certain age was required, each child was considered equ-al to
one year 111 the computation of tho aec of the father.
