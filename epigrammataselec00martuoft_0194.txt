Pinguescat nimio madidus mihi crinis amomo
Lassenturque rosis tempora sutilibus.

Iam vicina iubent nos vivere Mausolea, 5
Cum doceant, ipsos posse perire deos.

To Domitian, in praise of his exhibitione in the amphitheatre.

Astra polumque dedit, quamvis obstante noverca,
Alcidae Nemees terror et Arcas aper
Et castigatum Libycae ceroma palaestrae
Et gravis in Siculo pulvere tusus Eryx,
Silvarumque tremor, tacita qui fraude solebat 5
Ducere nec rectas Cacus in antra boves.
Ista tuae, Caesar, quota pars spectatur harenae?
Dat maiora novus praelia mane dies.

1,] ‘Hercules was raised to the
gods, even against the will of Juno,
by slaying the Nemean lion and the
Erymanthian boar by defeating the
[ἰῖηιιῐι π’·,ιεεῇει the giant Antaeus,
and the Sicilian Ει·ιΧ in a boxing
match! 'lhe antithesis is in ver.
15, 16‚‘ so will >ou evyentnall be
deified for the slaughter of beasts in
the amphitheatre.'

3. castiyatmn] ‘Chastised,' con-
quemd—ceroma, pro ipso Antaeo
ceromate inuncto. A bold and dis-
pleasing figure of speech. Some,
however, take ‘ castigatum ' to mean
‘ pressed on ' the body, like ‘ ceroma
tere1·e,' Ep. 168. ὃς but this is
unlikely.

4. Eryae] Sec Virg. Aen. v. 402,

&c.—tusch‚ contusus3 alii fusus,
which is as good a reading for pro-
stratus, ‘ stretched at length.'

6. nee rectas] ·Et eas quidem
avcrsas‚' i. e. pulled backwards by
their tails. Ovid, Fast. i. 550, traxerat
aversus Cacus in antra fe1·as.'

7. quota pars} i.e. these, how-
ever, are but a small part of what
is seen in the Emperor's amphi-
theatre. An indirect compliment to
Domitian, who professed himself a
greater hero than the real Hercules.

8. novus—Mes πῑιιηο]ι F ach new
day in the moi·ning‚' which seems
to have been the time appropriated

to the fig hts between men and
beasts. Sege Ep. 435. 4.
