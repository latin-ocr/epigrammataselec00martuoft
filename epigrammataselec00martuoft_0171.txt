ΕΡ. 225. (V. xiv.)

The subject the same as Ep. 219.

Sedere primo solitus in gradu semper
Tunc, cum liceret occupare, Nanneius,
Bis excitatus terque transtulit castra,
Et inter ipsas paene tertius sellas

Post Gaiumque Luciumque consedit.

Οἱ

Illinc cucullo prospicit caput tectus
Oculoque ludos spectat indecens uno.
Et hinc miser deiectus in viam transit,
Subsellioque semifultus extremo

Et male receptus altero genu iactat,

lo

Equiti sedere Leitoque se stare.

2. cum liceret] Before the new
edict of Domitian (Ep. 219. ll.—
occupare, to secure a place by getting
there fiist.

3. excitatas] By Leitus or Oceanus
(iii. 95. 10, ⁸ et sedeo qua te suscitat
Oceanus.' Ep. 232. 4, and v. 214,
‘ut sedeas viso pallidus Oceano').—-
transtulit castra, decamped, moved
off.

4. paene tertius] He wedged him-
self between two sellae (perhaps
moveable chairs, diffcring from suh-
sellia, and appropriated to illustres
equites), so as to make almost a
third, but still compelled to stand
a little back sor want of room. We
cannot explain it ‘in the third row
almost between the seats ς’ for if lie
had been ter eoecitalzcs, hc would
have been moved back further still.
Hitherto he had been on the very
first row (primo gradu).

5. Gaius et Lucius] Mcre typi-

cal names of equites. Sce Mayor
on Juv. iv. 13.

7. indecens] Unsightlv, ἀπρεπὴς,
as if luscus. So 70. 4, ⁶ Quod paene
terram tangit indecens nasus,' and
‘cui comparatus indecens erat pavo,q
243. 1ἵ.); lib. xii. 2¹2. l, ‘quam sit
lusca Philaenis indecenter) He
veiled his face with his cowl or hood,
so as not to be scen, and so detectcd.
-prospicll‚ θεᾶται, views the play.

ὃ. in viam] He is made to butlge
still further back, till he is shifted
into the pathway or assage between
the equites and the plebs He could
not leave this without sitting amon-12y
the plebs; so he makes a desperate
effort to half sit, half kneel at the
very end of a bench, neither on it.
nor off it, so that he can say he is
or is not sitting, according to cir-
cumstances. —arlremm the last of
the fourtcen tows—Leito, see Ep.

219. 12.

(V. xvi.)

The poet hints that little profit accrues from writing epigrams, and
playfully threatens to adopt a more lucrative pursuit.

Seria cum possim, quod delectantia malo
Scribere, tu causa es, lector amice, mihi,

1. Seria—Scribere] e. g. orations
or causes for cliente—delectantia,

viz. meipsum. In the reeedinq
