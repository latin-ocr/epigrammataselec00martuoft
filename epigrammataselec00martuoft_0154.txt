taneously sor his friend what it would not do sor Nero when he wished {t

to drown his mother.

Dum petit a Baulis mater Caerellia Baias,
Occidit insani crimine mersa freti.

Gloria quanta perit vobis! haee monstra Neroni
N ec iussae quondam praestiteratis aquae.

1. Baulis (Bagola)] Tac. Ann. xvi.
4 (Aerippinam Nero) ⁸ ducit Baulos,
id villae nomen est, quae promon-
torium Misenum inter et Baianum
lacum flexo mari alluitur? It had
belonged to Hortensius, whose
famous fish-pond was there, and is
still known as Peschiara d' Ortensio.
The name was originally Boaulia,
said to have been the place where
Hercules stabled the cows he
brought away from Cacus. So Sym-
machus says, ‘Huc Deus Aloidas
stabulanda armenta coegit—Inde

recens aetas corrupta Boaulia Baulos
Nuncupat occulto nominis indicia*
4. nec] For ne jussae quidcm3

not even when νου were ordered tn ·

drown. For the full account of Ncro'u
plot against Agrippina, cf. Tac. Ann.
xiv. 4, sqq. The sense is, ‘You
(the sea) have now lost the credit

you had gained, viz. for being mer-

ciful; for you refused Nero’s un-
natural request, even when hc rem
quired you to kill his mothor,' i. (¹-
purposely contrived that she should
be drowned.

On the villa suburbana of Julius Martialis, on the Janiculan hill, across
the Tiber. This man, mentioned in Ep. 273. 333, and elsewhere, wasa

purtisan of Otho, Tac. H. i. 28. 82.

Iuli iugera pauca Martialis

Hortis Hesperidum beatiora.

Longo Ianiculi iugo recumbunt:

Lati collibus imminent recessus

Et planus modico tumore vertex ⁵

Caelo perfruitur sereniore,

Et curvas nebula tegente valles

Solus luce nitet peculiari:

Puris leniter admoventur astris

Lpauea] Seeinf.ve1·.3l, ‘Though

&Q—longsojuyo, the long ridge or
bank, running nearly parallel with,
and down to the Tiber.

4. recessus] wide sweeps (reaches,
or hollows) overlook the hills on the
other side of the Tiber. So Ep.
333. he says of the same villa, ‘ vici-

nam videt unde lector urbem.' See

summit, almost level in its gentle
swell, has the enjoyment of a purer
atmosphere.'
