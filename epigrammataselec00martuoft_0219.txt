Optat et obscuras luces ventosque nivesque,
Odit et hibernos, si tepuere, dies.

Quid fecere mali nostrae tibi, saeve, lacernae,

Cu

Tollere de scapulis quas levis aura potest?
Quanto simplicius, quanto est humanius illud,
Mense vel Augusto sumere gausapinas?

come, just because he has a store of
lacernae to shown—ynusupinas, sc.
vestes or lacernas, mautles ofbaize or
frieze, felted and made thick to keep
off the cold. See xiv. 145, paenula
qausapiua: ‘Is mihi candor inest,
villorum gratia tanta, Ut me vel uie-
dia sumere messe velis.' Becker, Gai-
lus, p. 419. They were costly winter
mautles, somethiuglike the καυνάκης
of Ar. Vesp. 1137. Baccara had a
large number of these (se-rcmztas, in-
definite), and preferred shade to sun-
shine, cold to warin days, iu ordei·
to display them. Persius calls a per-
fumed heard balanatum yuusczpe, iV.

such a spite against my {rita lucerna
(Ep. 407. 22) :is to wish for cold wezi-
ther, which it would be no proni

from niy shoulderP' So Ep. 12, 3,
‘ Quid tantum fecere boni tibi pes-
sima vina?q ——Zucmnam often used iu
the plural, because it includes both
the cloak and the hood. Hence ⁴ totae
lacernae' in Propert. V. 8. 85. See
Ep. 78. ὃς 196. 5.

7. simplicius] Showirq less affcc-
tationg lautumias, more good nature
to others, who can less emily bear
the cold. ⁴ Rather than wish for ‹sol-l
weather, you should wear your line
cloaks in August3 your real widi
being only that we may see and ad-
mire them.'

To a conceited writer, who had just published a book.

Rem factam Pompullus habet, Faustine: legetur
Et nomen toto sparget in orbe suum.
Sic leve flavorum valeat genus Usiporum,
Quisquis et Ausonium non amat imperium.
Ingeniosa tamen Pompulli scripta feruutur: 5
‚Sed famae non est hoe, mihi erede, sutis.

l. renzfiwtam] He has gained his

beves—Faustine, see Ep. 110. 6.

3. Sic—valeat] ‘ So surely may the
Geruians and all other enemies of
Rome thrive Γ i. e. may their chance
of thriving be only as great as Pom-
pulli s' is of fame. Or rather, perhaps,

‘May that kind of fame, viz. to be
talked about but not praised, attach
to our enemies.' On the revolt of
theffffipi’ see Agric.. ⁵28. 3'2; Hi>t.

5. Inyeniosa] The poet distin>
guishes between insyem'nnz, a sort of
acquired cleverness. and qenins, in
oui· sense of the word, innate tali—nt.
