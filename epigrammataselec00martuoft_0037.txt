ΕΡ. 16. (I. xxvii.)

On the danger of giving your friend an invitation to dine with you next
day when sitting over your wine, lest he should accept it, and reinenibcr

10 come.

Hesterna tibi nocte dixeramus,

Quincunces puto post decem peractos,

Cenares hodie, Procille, meeum.

Tu factam tibi rem statim putasti

Et non sobria verba subnotasti 5
Exemplo nimium periculoso ι

Μισῶ μνάμονα συμπόταν, Procille.

2. quinczcnces] Cups holding five-
txrelsths of the sextariu53 like tri-
ennes, sextantes, &c.

4.fac!am rem] You took it as
unfczit accompli, i.e. as meant in
cai-nest. So Ep. 305. l, ‘rein fac·-
tam Pompullus liabct.'—szc¹›nol‹ssti‚
¹ you took down‚' ‘ made a note 0f‚'
perhaps in the ² tablets of the nie-
ῐηοι“)’.Ἴ Cf. Ep. 317. 3, ‘ cum voltu
digitoque subnotasset.' So the
Greeks use ὑπωλυγίζεσθαι.-θκωη-
plo, δὶα, ‘by adangcrous pl‘ecedent,'
and one that might fill your house

with guests that you never really
intended to ask—mod», &c.‚ words
from some σκολιὸν, or drinking-
song, in which μνάμονα referred to
the rccalling and repea‘ing on the
following day words that had been
uttcred over the wine. Here there
is a. play on the sense, ‘1 hate a
boon—companion with a memory!

quam pocula nostra reum.' So ⁸ in-
caute, simpliciter cenare,q Pliny, Ep.
i. 15. 4.

ΕΡ. 17. (Ι. xxx.)

On an unsucccssful surgeon who had turned undertaker. There is a
play on the double sense of κλίνη, meaning the bed of a siek patient, and
thelectus, or bier. Hence our phrase elinz‘eal, applied to instructions in
hospitale, &a Cf. Ep. 500. l. The joke is not brilliant, but the poet
repeats it, i. 47, ⁴ Nuper erat medicus, nunc est vispillo Diaulus; Quod
vis illo facit, fecerat et medicus? ln both there is an allusion to the doctor
kil ing his patients3 hence quo poleral ‘morlo meanS, that he was already
vcrsed in the (ιι-ις that it was in his line to be an undertaker.

Chirurgus fuerat, nunc est vispillo Diaulus.
Coepit quo poterat clinicus csse modo.
