M. VAL. MARTJALIS

Caesaris haec nostri pars est quota? vidit in undis
Et Thetis ignotas et Galatea feras3

Vidit in aequoreo ferventes pulvere currus 5
Et domini Triton isse putavit equos:

Dumque parat saevis ratibus fera praelia Nereus,
Horruit in liquidis ire pedester aquis.

Quidquid et- in Circo spectatur et Amphitheatro,

Dives Caesarea praestitit unda tibi.

Fucinus et pigri taceantur stagna Neronis:
Hane norint unam saecula naumachiam.

4. iynotas—fi’ras] WVhether real
ereatures, such as seals, or crocodilos,
unknown or unfamiliar to the people3
or land animals, as bulls and horse-s,
unknown to Thetis, because alien
from the water, but taught to per-
form in it oron it, may be doubted.
Domitian, according to Suetonius,
ξ 14, gave a ‘proelium navale in
ainpliitheatro,' from which it must
be inferred that the floor of the
Colosseum. to some depth, could be
flooded with water.

5. Vidit, cxc] ‘Triton saw eha-
riots at full speed on a watery plain '
(or, ‘ on a dusty course now turned
into water’), ⁶ and fancied that the
hippocampi of his lord and master
Neptune had run the race.' There
is, perhaps, an intentionai ambi-
guity in domini, meaning also the
emperor.

8. ire pedester] We cannot ex—
plain this exactly‚ without knowing

more of the spectacle than we do.
It seems from the context that Ne-
reus stood 011 some bridge or elevated
position above the water, and thence
gave the sign for the fight. So in the
very fine account of the battle of
Actium, Propert. v. C. 25, ‘tandem
acies geminos Nereus lunarat in
arcus.'

9. Quidquid] ‘ Both horse-racing
and the baiting of animals are dis-
played in this rich treat on Caesar's
lake.'—Dives, rich in resourees‚ va-
ried in amusement. If the reading
be right, we have the rare licence of
the α in Caesarea made long before
the r of the next word.

1 . Neronis] Nero too gave a sea—
fight, though he is called pz'jyer, or
‘⁵10va in comparison with Domi-
tian. Suet. Ner. ἓ 12, ‘exhibuit et
napniafhiam‚ marina aqua innantibus
be uis.

ΕΡ. 701. (Lib. Speet. xxix.)

On a pair of gladiatore who had fought so long and so well, that the people
began to call for both to be spared, and presented with the missio (Ep. 655.
7). The emperor couceded to the request‚ only on condition that the law
of the arena should be carried out3 viz. that one should fight till he gave

in, which appears to have been notified by raising a finger.

Hence ‘ con-

currere ad digitum ' meant *to fight to the last;' unless the phrase refers to
the ⁵ verso pollice vulgiss Juv. iii. 36, where see Mr. Mayor.

Cum traheret Priscus, traheret certamina Verus
Esset et aequalis Mars utriusque diu,
