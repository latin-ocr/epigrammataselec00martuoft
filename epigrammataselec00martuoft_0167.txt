Qualiter Assyrios renovant incendia nidos,
Una decem quotiens saecula vixit avis,
Taliter exuta est veterem nova Roma senectam
Et sumpsit voltus praesidis ipsa sui.
Iam precor oblitus nostrae, Volcano, querelae 5
Parce: sumus Martis turba, sed et Veneris:
Parce, pater: sic Lemniacis lasciva eatenis
Ignoscat coniunx et patienter amet.

1. Quasiler, &c.] As the Phoenix
is said to arise renovatcd from the
ashes of its own nest as soon as it

of Mars our ancestor, with Venus,

from Mars, through Romulus, we
are also from Venus, through Ae-
neas.

7. catenis] See Hom. Od. viii.

complaining of your deformity.

(V. viii.)

A rich libertus havin taken possession of the seat of an eques, to which

Ep. 225.

Edictum domini deique nostri,

Quo subsellia certiora fiunt

Et puros eques ordines recepit,

Dum laudat modo Phasis in theatro, ,
Phasis purpureis ruber lacernis, 5
Et iactat tumido superbus ore:

“Tandem commodius licet sedere,

l. Edictum] The order issued by
Domitian as censor (Ep. 2:52. 3),
that the old distinction made by
Roscius Otho should be strictly
cnforced, viz. that fourteen rows iu
the theatro, next above the senators,
should be rosei-ved for the equites

deique, a style actually adopted by
the emperor himself, and not used
here in iron or mere flattery. See
Ep. 563. .--certiora‚ ‘more spe-
eially appropriated.' Certus is only

the participle of cerno (cretus).

3. paros] καθαροὺς, unmixed with
others, who were merely wealthy
or ambitious persons, but not true
horn equites

5. richer] The lacerna was red
(either coccina or sea-purple), worn
over the white toga. It is not clear
that it was exclusively the dress of
an equeS, though it was a military
garment. (Ovid. Fast. ii. 745,
Propert. v. 3. 18.)
