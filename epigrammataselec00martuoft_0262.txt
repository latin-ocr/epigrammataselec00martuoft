Ad natalicias dapes vocabar,

Essem cum tibi, Sexte, non amiens.

Quid factum est, rogo, quid repente factum est,

Post tot pignora nostra, post tot annos

Quod sum praeteritus vetus sodalis? 5
Sed causam seio. Nulla venit a me

Nec levis toga, nee rudes lacernae.
Non est sportula, quae negotiatur.
Pascis munera, Sexte, non amicos.
Iam dices mihi ‘⁶ Vapulet vocator.'’
