Paret purpureis aper capistris ;
Turpes esseda quod trahunt bisontes
Et molles dare iussa quod choreas

Nigro belua non negat magistro z

10

Quis spectacula non putet deorum Ρ
Haec transit tamen, ut minora, quisquis
Venatus humiles videt leonum,

Quos velox leporum timor fatigat.

Dimittunt, repetunt amantque captos

15

Et securior est in ore praeda,

Laxos cui dare perviosque rictus
Gaudent ct timidos tenere dentes,
Mollem frangere dun] pudet rapinam,

Stratis cum modo venerint iuvencis.

Haec clementia non paratur arte,
Sed norunt cui serviant leones.

8. turpes] The ugly or unsightly
aurochs(bison lim-opacus), still exist-
ing in the forcsts of Lithuania.
Virg. Georg. iii. 51, ⁸ optuma torvae
Forma bovis, cui turpe ‹;·aput.'

10. belna] The elephant, called
Gaetula in Juv. x. 158⁴ — molles,
soft, light, and not such as a creature
of huge bulk could naturally give.—

m'yro, its black keeper.—spect‹u¹zda,

‘pageants.'

12. transit ut minora] wonderful
as- these sights are in themselves,
they are nothing to the scats per-
formed by the lions.

14. leporum timor] The timid
epeed of the hare satigues the lion,
who is taught to catch it aud play
with it, as a cat does with a mouse,
and probably by the sanic feline
instinct—amant, they hug, fondle
them when caught, ἀν) απῶσι, cai-ess

’ them-securior, ‘feels safer,' is

ΕΡ. 54.

‘ more fearlcss,' an hyperbole. Tho
hare feels itsclf safer, because better
protectetl, iu the liou's mouth3 for
it holds its tceth looscly closed, and
so that the hare can get through
them, as if sear-ful of doing harm.
So Lucretius says ofthe hound fond-
ling its young, v. 1069, ‘suspensis
teneros imitantur dentibus haus-
tus.'

20. stratis juvencis] ‘ After laying
low hciscrs, it is ashamed to crunch
the bones of a hare.5 τιιυιιοκτόυων
λεόντων ἕψεόρε, Soph. Phil. 400,
-ιινία, educatione. The lions, hc
says, with servile flattery, know that
they arc serving a clement master.
Note, that cui is a dissyllable (⁹⁹).
So perhaps in Juv. iit 49, ‘quis
nunc diligitur, nisi conscius, et cui
fervens,' &m Ep. 425. 3, ‘ Drusorum
cui contigere barbae.'

(I. cvii.)

The poet's reply to his friend Lucius Julius (Mm-tialis? Ep. 198), who
had urged him to attempt some great work, to which he rejoins‚ that he
will write like Horace and Virgil, when he has found as liberal a patror

as they had.
