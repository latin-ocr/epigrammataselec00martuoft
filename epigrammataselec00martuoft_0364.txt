Desiderantur, nee Marica nec Liris,

Nec in Lucrina lota Salmacis vena.

llic summa leni stringitur Thetis vento;
Nec languet aequor, viva sed quies ponti
Pictam phaselon adiuvante fert aura,
Sicut puellae non amantis aestatem

Mota salubre purpura venit frigus.

15

Nec seta longo quaerit in mari praedam,
Sed e cubiclo lectuloque iactatam
Spectatus alte lineam trahit piscis.

Si quando Nereus sentit Aeoli regnum,

{idat procellas tuta de suo mensa.

Piscina rhombum pascit et lupos vernas,
Natat ad magistrum delicata muraena3

of the sca is just ruffled by the
gentle breeze, and there is not a
dead calm, but the lively. yet quiet

line to the fish inunediately below.
Pliny, Epist. ix. 7. 4, ‘ex illa (gesta

culo ac paene de lectulo ut e naucula

jacere.q

19. Si quando. &c.] ‘If ever the
sea is ruffled by the wind, the table,
supplied by its own resourceS, can
