ΕΡ. 449. (ΙΧ. xi.)

This and the two next epigrams are very elegant allusions 1ο the name
of a handsome boy, a favourite of Domitian's, called Εανίηοε (Έαρινὸς,
vernus). The poet complains that the word is unsuited to metre, and that
the Latin language will not admit the lieence of the Greek, aud make it
ezarznos.

Nomen oum violis rosisque natum,

Quo pars optima nominatur anni,

Hyblam quod sapit Atticosque flores,

Quod nidos olet alitis superbae ς’. v

Nomen neetare dulcius beato, 5
Quo mallet Cybeles puer vocari

Et qui poeula temperat Tonanti:
Quod si Parrhasia sones in aulas:
Respondent Veneres Cupidinesque3
Nomen nobile, molle, delicatum
Versu dieere non rudi volebam:

Sed tn syllaba contii-max repugnas. '
Dieunt Eiarinon tamen poetae,

Sed Graeci, quibus est nihil negatum
