M. VA L. MARTIALIS

{alia damna decent‚' viz. frequentat*
luuna.

ΕΡ. 35. (Ι. lxxi.)

On the custom ofinvoking the names of absent mistresses (ie. in order,

by a kind of omen, to secure their presence).

This was donc by toasting

them with as many cyathi, or lzulles of wine and water, as there were letters
in the name. Hence ⁴ invocare scortum in couvivio,’ Plaut. Capt. 73. See

inf. Ep. 424. 21 ; (508, 7.

Laevia sex cyathis, septem Iustina bibatur,
Quinque Lycas, Lyde quattuor, Ida tribus.

Omnis ab infuso numeretur amica Falerno,
Et quia nulla venit, tu mihi, Somne, veni.

3. numeretur] ‘ Be counted by the
number of ladles,' i.e. letters in her
name (as Ida. Lyde, Lycas, three,
four, five, &c.). The preposition

erhaps means, ‘ beginning the first
etter of each with the first ladle3'
but the exact meaning of the verso
is rather obscure.

ΕΡ. 36. (I. lxxii.)
On Fidentinus the plagiarist (sup. Ep. 28).

Nostris versibus esse te poetam,

Fidentine, putas cupisque credi?

Sic dentata sibi videtur Aegle

Emptis ossibus Indicoque cornu3

Sic quae nigrior est cadente moro, 5
Cerussata sibi placet Lycoris.

Hac et tu ratione qua poeta es,

Calvus cum fueris, eris comatus.

3. sic] On the same principle, viz.
of using borrowed ornaments, or
being furnished with things not her
own—dentata, an adjective of par-
ticipial form, like toyalus, capillutus,
&c. The use of artificia] teeth is
mentioned also in Ep. 650, ‘den-
tibus atque comis, nec te pudet,
uteris emptis.'

5. moro] A mulberry fully ripe
and ready to fall, when it is nearly
black.—oerussata, when she has used
cerussa, ψιμύθιον, white lead, as a

cosmetic. This Lycoris was a bru-
nette beauty3 but the Romans pre-
ferred thestari crines and the candor
to the bilious-looking dark com-
plexion. Comp. iv. 62, ‘Tibur in
Herculeum migravit nigra Lycoris,
Omnia dum fieri candida credit ibi.'

8. cumfueris‚ Se] ὅταν γηράσκῃς.
WVhen old, you will wear false hair,
and be comatus quite as truly as fou
are now poeta, i. e. both claims a ike
being shams and pretences.
