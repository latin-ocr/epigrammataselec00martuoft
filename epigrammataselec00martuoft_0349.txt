ΕΡ. 510. (X. iv.)

Martial recommends the perusa] of his epigrams‚ as treating of real life,
in preference to the fables of antiquity.

Qui legis Oedipoden caligantemque Thyesten,
Colchidas et Scyllas, quid nisi monstra legis?

Quid tibi raptus Hylas, quid Parthenopaeus et Attis,
Quid tibi dormitor proderit Endymion?

Exutusve puer pinnis labentibus? aut qui .··›
Odit amatrices Hermaphroditus aquas?

Quid te vana iuvant miserae ludibria chartae?
Hoc lege, quod possit dicere vita ‘⁴ Meum est.'’

Non hie Centauros, non Gorgonas Harpyiasque

Invenies: hominem pagina nostra sapit.
