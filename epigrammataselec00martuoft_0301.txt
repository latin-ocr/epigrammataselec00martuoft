EPIGRAMMATA.

Omnis habet sua dona dies 3 nec linea dives
Cessat, et in populum multa rapina cadit.
Nunc veniunt subitis lasciva nomismata nimbis,

Nunc dat spectatas tessera larga feras,

Nunc implere sinus securos gaudet et absens
Sortitur dominos, ne laceretur, avis.

Quid numerem currus ter denaque praemia palmae,
Quae dare non semper consul uterque solet?

Omnia sed, Caesar, tanto superantur honore,

7. linea [lives] All sorts of con-
jectures have been formed as to the
meaning of these words, which some
refer to the scats of the senators in
the theatre, others to the ‘linea

mention of 1n.·t1ga·1it2'oe in the pas-
§.ige above quoted, and altogether

9. nomismata] This was probably
contrived in much the same way as
in Nero's golden house, where the

looms were ceiled, ‘tabulis versatili-
bus, ut flores, fistulatis, ut unguenta
desuper spargerentur.' Suet. Ner. 31.

10. tessvra] These tickets were
not only given for seeing the figlits
in the amphitheatre, but every one
afterwards received something for
them, sometimes birds, sometimes
beasts, and so on 3 so in the following!

13. currus] Factionum3 the
iaces in the Gneus-ter (lma, an

the number of prizes given.

Omnes aut vetulas habes amicas,
Aut turpes vetulisque foediores.
