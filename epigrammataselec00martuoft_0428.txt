ΕΡ. 633. (XI. xci.)

A very beautiful epitaph on a young girl who died of cancer in the lip.

Aeolidos Canace iacet hoc tumulata sepulcro,
Ultima cui parvae septima venit hiems.

Ah scelus, ah facinus! properas quid fiere, viator?
Non licet hic vitae de brevitate queri.

Tristius est leto leti genus: horrida voltus 5
Abstulit et tenero sedit in ore lues, .

Ipsaque crudeles ederunt oscula morbi,
Nec data sunt nigris tota labella rogis.

Si tam praecipiti fuerant ventura volatu,

Debuerant alia fata venire via.

words of the fletus, which the poet

4. hic] In this instance, because

she was taken off.

6. lues] Cf. Ep. 50. 6, ‘ Ureret im-
plicitum cum scelerata lues?

9. volatu] Perhaps iu reference to
Effert “n''rkpoevssa.

10. (clia—ricc] Viz. than through
that fair mouth.

12. <imas-cleas] The fates, who
might have been influenced by het
sweet voice.

ΕΡ. 634. (XI. xciii.)

On the house ofa bad poet being bui-ned down. Martial says it is a pit>-
that the owner was not burned with it.

Pierios vatis Theodori flamma penates

Abstulit.

Hoc Musis et tibi, Phoebe, placet?
