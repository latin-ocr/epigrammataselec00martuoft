Sed magnum vitium, quod est poeta,
Pullo Maevius alget in cucullo,
Cocco mulio fulget Incitatus.

cucullo, a cowl or cape of dark colour,

On an ignorant physician who had died of a rapid fover.

Nequius a Caro nihil unquam, Maxime, factum est,

Quam quod febre perit:

feeit et illa nefas.

Saeva nocens febris saltem quartana fuisset!

a fever. The sever, too, was greatly
to blame3 it should at least have
been an acute and painful quai-tan
attack‚ that the patient might have

Mr. Mayor on Juv. iv. 57, renders

boon, if not completely cui-ed, at
least changed into a quartan.'

Pliny's Epistles‚ but it is not easy to identify them.

Et seeum comitem trahet pudorem.

l. Salonas] This was a town on
the coast of Dalmatia⁷ opposite to
Ancona on the east coast of Italy.—
