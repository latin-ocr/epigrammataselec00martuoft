ΕΡ. 694. (Lib. Spect. i.)

A eulogy of the great Colosseum lately completed and opencd by Titus.
Suet. Tit. ἓ7, ⁸ amphitheatro dedicato, thermisque juxta celeriter exstruc-
tis, munus edidit apparatissimum largissimumqucff All the wondrous
structures in the world, the poet sayS, are now eclipsed by the great Am-
phitheatre at Rome,-the Pyramhls, the walis of Babylon, the Temple of
Diana at Ephesus in Ionia, and of Apollo at Delos, and the Mausoleum in
Caria.

Barbara pyramidum sileat miracula Memphis,
Assyrius iactet nee Babylona labor;

Nec Triviae templo molles laudentur Iones,
Dissimulet Delon cornibus ara frequens3

A'e're nec vacuo pendentia Mausolea 5
Laudibus immodicis Cares in astra ferant.

Omnis Caesareo cedit labor Amphitheatro,
Unum pro cunctis fama loquetur opus.

3. molles—Iones] This people were
considered ἁβροὶ and effeminate.
Plropertius has ‘mollis Ionia,' i. 6.

4. Dissimulet] ⁴ Let the altar
built with the horus of many victims
think less of (disquisit, οι· put out of
sight) its Delos.= See Gallim. Hymn
εἰς Ἀπολλ. 61, ὁ δ’ ἕπλεκε βωμὸν
Ἀπόλλων. Δείμιιτο μὲν κεράεσσι
θεμέθλια, πῆξε ὂὲ βωμὸν Ἐκ κε-
ράων· κεραοὺς δὲ περὶξ ἐπεβάλλετο
Ἶοίχους.

5. pendentia] It appears from this
that the Mausoleum was especially
famed for being balanced on pillars
in a way that appeared wonderful to
the beholder. This passage is im-
portant in reference to the somewhat
disputed restoration of the desit-fn, of
which so many fragments have of
late years been recovered.

8. pro eunctis] Because all the
skill devoted to these buildings is
now included in one.

ΕΡ. 695. (Lib. spect. ii.)
