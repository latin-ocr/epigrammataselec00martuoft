iv TO THE READER.

all scholars admit—for it 15 a remarkable fact, that no
complete edition of Martial with explanatory notes has
ever appeared, either in England or in Germany‚ since
the ‘variorum’ editions of nearly two centuries ago,
which, even when they can be procured‚ are behind the
requirements of the age,—-one principal difficulty pre-
sented itself. However brilliant the wit, however valu-
able the details of domestic Roman life and of Roman
topography, and however admirable the poetry and the
latinity of Martial, there is this valid ground of objection
to the use of his epigrams 111 50110015, that not less than a
fourth part of them is exceedingly gros‘S, and quite unfit
for general reading. The same, indeed, may justly be said
of Catullus, Juvenal, Aristophanes, and some others;
but the remedy of expurgation has long ago been 50 far
applied to them, as to make them not only endurable,
but highly popular in 50110015. Now selection, which is
the plan we resolved upon, has obvious advantages over
expurgation; and it 15 fortunate that of all authors
Martial most readily admits of selection, because each
epigram is quite complete in itself ¹. Since, however,
many of the epigrams are very difficult, and require a
large amount of illustration, we feared that it would be
found impossible to include 111 0110 moderately sized volume
all the residue, i. e. all the really readable epigrams. We
were compelled, therefore, to select again from these 3 and
that was a task in itself requiring a good deal of time and
judgment. Having agreed, in common consultation‚ as to
