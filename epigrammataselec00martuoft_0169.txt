Ennius est lectus salvo tibi, Roma, Marone
Et sua riserunt saecula Maeoniden:
Rara coronato plausere theatra Menandro,

Norat Nasonem sola Corinna suum.

Vos tamen, o nostri ne festinate libelli:
Si post fata venit gloria, non propero.

was burnt down in the Vitellian
emente, and had been restored by
Domitian. Its history is briefly
given in Tac. Hist. iii. 72, who
adds, ‘Lutatii Catuli nomen inter
tanta Caesarum opera usque ad
Vitellium mansit.' It was dedicated
aare. 685. See Ep. 279. 2.

9. rara, &c.] Thin houses (as

we say) applauded Menander when
he gained a prize; and even Ovid
was not read by any but his Co-
rinna.

12. venit] i. e. vobis. ‘If I gain
fame after my death,I am content
to wast? Cf. Pliny, Epist. i. xvi.
11, ‘Neque enim debet operibus
ejus obesse quod vivit? Elsewhere
the poet says, ‘cineri gloria sera
venit,' but in reference to profit
made by his writings.

On Stella, a wealthy friend and poet (see Ep. 31. 4), with a complimcnt

on his elegance and popularity.

Multas in digitis, plures in carmine gemmas
Invenies: inde est haee, puto, culta manus.

l. znmrcqsdos] A green gem, jasper veryhighly. See Ep. 476. 20,

supposed to be emerald. In iv.
28. 4, we have⁷ ‘Indos sardonychas,
Scythas zmaragdos' (qu. Russian
malachite Ρ). The word is perhaps
Sanscrit. It seems to have been
pronounced both 'wzaraqdus and
smarayzcs. See Propert. iii. 7. 44.
Pliny, N. H. 37. 62 seqq—afla-
mantas, probably diamonds, which
first become mentioned as genis about
this period (il1.§ 76). <Tho adamas
of the earlier poets means basalm—
in articulo, viz. in his equestrian
ring or rings. The Romans valued

‘ ct pretium magnis feeit iaspidibus.'
Juv. v. 42, ‘da veniam; praeclara
illic laudatur iaspi5.' Our jasper
is a valueless material. Perhaps
the Romans meant opas, or some
equally rare stone. The description
of it in Pliny, N. H. 37, ἓ 115,
suits the iridescent character of
opal.

4. inde] He intimatos that the
rings were presents on account of his
oeni. Ladios used to present rinus.
