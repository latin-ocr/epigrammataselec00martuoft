MARTIALIS

(V. xix.)

A complimcnt to Domitian, on his public benefits as a prince, and an

indirect rcqucst for lis patron-age.

Si qua fides veris, praeferri, maxime Cacsar,
Temporibus possunt saccula nulla tuis.

Quando magis dignos licuit spectare triumphos?
Quando Palatini plus meruere dci?

Pulchrior et maior quo sub duce Martia Roma? 5
Sub quo libertas principe tanta fuit?

Est tamen hoc vitium, sed non leve, sit licet unum,
Quod colit ingratas pauper amicitias.

Quis largitur opes veteri fidoque sodali,

Aut quem prosequitur non alienus eques?

1. teris] ’τοῖς ἀληθευτικοῒς.
Vulg. veri.

3. triumphos] Viz those in Ger-
many and Dacia. Ep 3. 33 64. 3.

4. Palatini-dei] The gods wor-
shipped on the Palatine as Apollo,
Jupiter, Vesta, Miner;va but with
-ιη allusion to the emperms as 1·-e
siding there.

5. [Uareia Roma] Coupled with
duce, this conveys a military com-
pliment under a common-mace ex-
pression. We have ‘ Martia turba*
for literary Rome in Ep. 2. 4.-
principe, the constitutional term, as
αἰιυ and imperator are military
titlcs. F01 libel-‚ty not military

g-lmy, is now praised.

3 Quod colit] That a poor man
has to cultivate friendships, which
give him no return (so‘ ingrata
spatia campi, ³ Ep. 148. 4). He
means, that pations ill requite
the attendance (officium) of their
clients.

10. non alienus] i.e.
cus' What patron is now-a-da)s
es( cited b) an equestrian client th tt
is sincerely endu-ned to him by his
kindness and liberality? This seems
the simplest and best sense. Others

‘vel'e ami-

take alienus to mean an honorary
knight, viz. not one by birth, but
by imperial favour. Cf. xiv. 122,
Ante frequens, scd nunc rarus nos
donat amicus ἔ Felix cui comes est
non alienus eques.' The term ‘alien '
may have been given in disparage-
ment to those who were not ‘justi,‘
‘1·egulars,' i.e. possessing the full
census, Ep. 200. 4.

ll. To have sent (to a client) a
silver spoon of half a. pound at tho
Saturnalia, or a flame-coloured toga,
the whole eost of which does not
exceed ten scruples, is extravagance, ·
and >our haughty nobles speak of
these things as gifts. one there may
be to talk about (or to chink
κωδωνίζειν, i e in presenting) gold
coins. Cf. Ep 659 3, ‘aureolos
manu crepantes and 37.14. Pers.
