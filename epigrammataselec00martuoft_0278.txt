Μ. VAL. MARTIALIS

Nou Athamanteo potius me mirer in auro,

Aeolium dones si mihi, Phrixe, pecus.

20

Ο quantos risus pariter spectata movebit
Cum Palatina nostra lacerna toga!

19. inaure] Dressed 1111110 golden
ssccce of Phrixus, 5011 of Athamas,

22. nostra] Is rather ambiguous.
11 mav mean ⁶ osus knights* (of which

the la'cerna was a distinctive dress),

as ‘noster eques,’ Ep. 227. 23 or‘my
mande-‚³ as opposed to ‘your present
ofa toga’ Any how, it 15 a hint that
he would like a new one.

(ΕΡ. 408. VIII. XXX.)

On the firmness with which a man (probably a condemned malefactor,

or perhaps Christian, cf. Ep. 527) acted the
bui-nt his hand off iu some games in the amphit

art of Mucius Scaevola, and
lieatre. Compare Lib. Spcct. 7,

where a criminal was compelled 10 act the part of Laureolus (from a play
by Catullus), and in that character was exposed upon a 01055, to be inanglcd
by a bear. It ends thus: ⁴ Vicerat antiquae sceleratus crimina famae,
111 qim, quae fuerat fabula, poena fuit.' This is a very fine epigram.

Qui nunc Caesareae lusus spectatur harenae,
Temporibus Bruti gloria summa fuit.

Aspicis, ut teneat flammas poenaque fruatur
Fortis et attonito regnet in igne manus l

Ipse 5111 spectator adest et nobile dextrae 5
Funus amat: totis pascitur illa saeris.

Quod nisi rapta foret nolenti poena, parabat
Saevior in lassos ire sinistra focos.

Scire piget post tale decus, quid fecerit ante:

Quam vidi, satis est hane mihi nosse manum.

1.] ‘ That which 15 now looked at
as a scenic drama in the amphi-
theatre, was in the times of Brutus
the height of glory.' lt was simply
for an exhibition of fortitude that
the spectacle was given in the am-
phitheatre.

3. teneat] ⁴ Grasps the 11111110,ἱ as
it were. -reymffi reigns supreme
over the excruciating torture.

7. Quod nisi, ἃς] ‘Had not the

10

punishment been denied him,
though against his will, his left
hand also⁷ more cruel to itself than
even his right, was ready to go into
the fire, which was itself tired of
inflicting so much pain.'

9.] After such an achievement,
Ido not care to know what crimes
he once committed. It 15 sufficient
for me to recognize the handiwork Ι
have scen.

ΕΡ. 409. (VIII. xxxii.)

On a dove that settled in the bosom of Aratulla‚ and would not leave it.
Martial hopes that (if prayers move the gods) it may be an omen of her
brother's recall from exile in Sardinia. lt contains an elegant and delicate

appeal to the emperor's mercy.
