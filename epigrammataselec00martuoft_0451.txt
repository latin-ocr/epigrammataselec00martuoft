ΕΡ. 666. (XII. m.)

A very elegant epitaph on Rufus a poet and orator, add1essed to his
surviving wife, S·enip10nia. This is perhaps the sanie Rufus whom the
poet so frequently addresscs as in Epp p¹ 7< 8 164, &c She had been induced
to leave her home by some paramour, but had returned to her husband.
Hence the allusions to the rape of Helen and of Proserpine.

Tempora Pieria solitus redimire corona,
Nee minus attonitis vox celebrata reis,
Hic situs est, hie ille 111116, Sempronia, Rufus,
Cuius et ipse tui flagrat amore einis.
Dulcis in Elysio narraris fabula eampo 5
Et stupet ad raptus Tyndaris ipsa tuos.
Tu melior, quae deserto raptore redisti :
Illa virum voluit nee repetita sequi.
Ridet, et Iliacos audit Menelaus amores:
Absolvit Phrygium vestra rapina Parim.
Accipient olim cum te loca laeta piorum,
Non erit iu Stygia notior umbra domo.
Non aliena videt, sed amat Proserpina raptas:
Iste tibi dominam conciliavit amor.
