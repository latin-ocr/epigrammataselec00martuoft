Stringitur in densa nec caeca novacula turba,
Occupat aut totas nigra popina vias.
Tonsor, copo, cocus, lanius sua limina servant.

N unc Roma est, nuper magna taberna fuit.

7. novacula] ‘ Razor.' Others,
froin the epithet caeca, the meaning
of which is certainly dubious, un-
deistand it of tl1e‚knife of the cut-
purse, which does not suit well here,
beside that it never elsewhere has
this niearing. The sense seems to

be, that hitherto the barbers had an

10

umbra or shaving-booth almost iu
the street, so that there was danger
(this in irony, of course) of drawing
tho razor from its case in the middle
of such a ‹lcnse crowd.

9. copo] refers to lemovis, ver. 5;
cacus aud lanius, to popina—swa
limina, see ver. ⁶2.

ΕΡ. 366. (vn. lxiii.)

Martia] lauds Silius Italicus not less for his powers as an advocate and

orator than as a poet. Cf. Ep. 165.

Perpetui nunquam moritura volumina Sili
Qui legis et Latia carmina digna toga,
Pierios tautum vati placuisse recessus
Credis-et Aoniae Baechica serta comae?
Sacra 'eethurnati non attigit ante Maronis, 5
Implevit magni quam Ciceronis opus. . K ζ
Hunc miratur adhuc centum gravis hasta virorum,
Hune loquitur grato plurimus ore cliens.
Postquam bis senis ingentem fascibus annum
Rexerat, asserto qui sacer orbe fuit, lo
Emeritos Musis et Phoebo tradidit annos,
Proque suo celebrat nune Helicona foro.

5. Sacra, &c.] Silius did not take
to writing poeti-y before he had read
through Cicero, viz. to learn elo-
quence. See Ep. 614.

7. centum — virorum] cf. Ep.
294. 5.-Jzastcz‚ a spem· was stuck in
the ground when the 100 held court,
being the symbol of quii-itarian
ownership. Cf. Suet. Aug. 36, ‘ut
centumviralem hastam (court) quam
quaestura functi consuerant cogere,
decemviri cogerent*

9. postquam. &c.] ‘After he had
been consul (attended by twclve

lictors) for the year which was held
sacred in the liberated world (viz.
that year in which Nero was slairr,
he devoted the years that remained
after his public services to the study
of poeti-y, and now frequents Helicon
instead of his own sphere of elo·
quenoe, the Forum.' The meaning
is. that he is engaged in writing the
Punica. -— inflantem - annum, au
allusion perhaps to the μέγας ἐνιαυ-
