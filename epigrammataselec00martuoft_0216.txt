because he (lid not choose to win. Caligula patronized the green, preminet,
which was probably the imperial colour. See Ep. 545. 23. Suet. Cal.

ΕΡ. 299. (VI. xlvii.)

Stella, the poet's wealthy friend, had named a spring in his villa after

his wife Ianthis (vi. 2] ς xii. 3. 12).

The poet professes to propitiate the

nymph for having without hex· leave drunk some of the spa—water when
unwell. The offering was a young pig, as Horace offers a kid to the

fountain of Bandusia (Carm. iii. 13).

Nympha, mei Stellae quae fonte domestica puro
Laberis et domini gemmea tecta subis,

Sive Numae eonium< Triviae te misit ab antris,
Sive Camenarum de grege nona venis ε

Exolvit votis hae se tibi virgine porea 5
Marcus, furtivam quod bibit aeger aquam.

l. domestica] ‘ Intradomum.' Itwas
possibly artificial, and conducted in
leaden pipes (Propert. iv. 2. 12)
from one of the aqueducts; but the
poet speaks of it as a spring, perhaps
in compliment. The Roman atria
were sometimes supplied with sa-
lientes, jets of water or fountains.
See Becker, Gallus, p. 251.

2. yemmea tecta] An artificial

rotto.

g 3. Numae conjzar. &el ‘W'hether
you come from the spring in the
grotto of Egeria, at Aricia‚' where
Diana (Trivia) was woxshipped, ⁴ or
are one of the Camenae) Egeria her-
sels was one of the Camenae (ancient
and indigenous Italian nymphs, in
later times associated with the
nine Muses). She was the confi-
nantc and secret adviser (some said

wife) of Numa. See Ovid, Fast.
iii. 154. The sense seems to be
‘whether Egeria sent you hither
from Aricia, or whether you are
Egeria herself, who has migratos
from thence to the house of Stella.'
Hence nona venis implies that the
ninth of that august number of
nymphs has found a more congenial
residence in Stella⁷s house (for he
was a poet) than elsewhere.

5. Eirolvit-seJ ‘Acquits himseh
of his vow.' A person was said
to be damnatus voti, when under
obligation to pay it.

6. fztrtz'vztm] thyficrlz'mm? ask
the commentators. Probably this
is in compliment to Stella. as if his
spa was so valuable as to be worth
taking at a hazard without special
permission.
