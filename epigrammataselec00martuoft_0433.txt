Vel si malueris, prima gradiere Subura:
Atria sunt illine consulis alta mei. ιο
Laurigeros habitat facundus Stella penates,
Clarus Iantheae Stella sititor aquae.
Fons ibi Castalius vitreo torrente superbus,
Unde novem dominas saepe bibisse ferunt.
Ille dabit populo patribusque equitique legendum, ιε)
Nec nimium siccis perleget ipse genis.
Quid titulum poscis? versus duo tresve legantur,
Clamabunt omnes te, liber, esse meum.

[Ο. consulis—mei] The house of

my friend Stella, who is now consul.
The poet had predicted this honour
in ix. 42. 6, where he says to Apollo,
‘ sic Palatia te colant amentque, Bis
senos cito te rogante fasces Det
Stellae bonu< annuatque Cacsar.'

12. [dalheim—aquae] See on Ep.
299. There are epigrams on this
subject also in vii. 15 aud 50.

14„ novem dominas] The Muses,
who are supposed to have been
guests in the house of Stella as a
poet, and so to have drunk the spa-
water as they would their own

Castaly.

ΕΡ. 641.

15. Ille dabit] Stella will take
care to have my books transm-ihm!
and placed in the hands of the
Romans generally3 aud he will hini-
self devote a tear as he reads it to
his absent friend.—nimfa1n, cf. 522. ’3.

17. titulus] A heading οι· title.
Probably none such was sent with
this book‚ but in place of it the
dedicatory letter to his friend Piiscus
Terentius, to whom also Ep. i. 4. 6⁵2
and others of this book are addressed,
and who appears from Ep. 4 (inf.)
to have been a liberal patron of the
poet's. Cf. 355. 6.

(ΧΠ. v.)

The tenth and eleventh book were made shorter than they would have
licen, berause the times under Domitian were too troublous to supply

lcisurely readers.
Tac. Agric. init.
but there seem no grounds for this.

Under Nerva and Trajan greater security existed. See
Some explain artatus of a new and shorter edition:

The point of the remark appeals to

he the hint to Caesar to procure the two preceding, and read them as well

as the twelfth now sent.

Longior undecimi nobis decimique libelli
Artatus labor est et breve rasit opus.

Plura legant vacui, quibus otia tuta dedisti3
Haeo lege tu, Caesam forsan et illa leges.

2. rasit] Scrapcd and filed down
the work to a brief compass. The
nominative is labor, which here
means ‘ trouble in composing.³ The
figure seems taken from a carpenter

planing wood to a less sizo.

4. et illa] The former books,
which he may not yet have scen.—
Ieyes, viz. when you have read this.
