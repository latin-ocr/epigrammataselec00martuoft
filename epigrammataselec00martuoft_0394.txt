Μ. VAL. MARTIALIS

Natalem colimus, tacete lites.

Absit cereus aridi clientis,

Et vani triplices brevesque mappae
Expectent gelidi iocos Decembris.
Certent muneribus beatiores.
Agrippae tumidus negotiator

Cadmi municipes ferat lacernas;

10

Pugnorum reus ebriaeque noctis

Cenatoria mittat advocato ;

Infamata virum puella vicit?
Veros sardonychas, sed ipsa tradat;

Mirator veterum senex avorum

15

Donet Phidiaci toreuma caeli,
Venator leporem, colonus haedum,
Piscator ferat aequorum rapinas.
Si mittit sua quisque, quid poetam

Missurum tibi, Restitute, credis?

cunque ergo lassitudine abjecta cc-
natoria repetimus, et in proximam
cellam ducti sumus, in qua tres lecti
strati erant et reliquus lautitiarum
apparatus splendidissime expositus*
Let some one, he says, who has got

send him a substantial memento for
his services.
