EPIGRAMMATA.

Occurris quotiens, Luperco, nobis τ
“Vis mittam puerum '³ subinde dieis,
‘⁶ Cui tradas epigrammaton libellum,

Lectum quem tibi protinus remittam ?''

Non est quod puerum, Luperco, vexes.
Longum est, si velit ad Pirum venire,
Et scalis habito tribus, sed altis.
Quod quaerispropius petas licebit.
Argi nempe soles subire letum ε
Contra Caesaris est forum taberna
Scriptis postibus hine et inde totis,
Omnes ut cito perlegas poetas.

Illinc me pete, nee roges Atrectum,—
Hoe nomen dominus gerit tabernae,—
De primo dabit alterove nido .

Rasum pumice purpuraque cultum

ἱ). vis mittam, &e.] He professes

to save the author unnecessary
trouble. This passage well shows
'the genius of the Latin subjunctive3
‘shall I send you' (you say)‘1ny
slave, to whom you may ⁴trive your
book of epigram, that I inay read
1110111, 111111 send them back di-
rectly?

5. ‘comare is ἐνοχλεῖν, 10 give
needless trouble 10.-(αἰ Pirum, ⁵ to
the pea1·-t1·ee‚' a wellrknowu mark,
perhaps (like the ⁴ ticus Ruminalis,'
or the κοίλη ἅχερὸιις, 110111· Athens,
Soph. Oed. (101. 1:306), bnt now
unknown. For the poct‘s place of
residence, see Ep. 55. 4.

7. scalis trihus] ‘ L'p three pairs
of stairs, and those high ones.¹
This is wittily said. Such a lodging
would give trouble to the slave, but
it also indicates that the lodger is
poor, and would prefer to sell rather
than to 101111 his books.

8. propius] See Ep. 37. 1⁰.—
nempe soles. ‘of course you are in
the habit of going near the Aryi-
letzcm,' where the book-shops were
to be foun‹l; see Ep. ⁵2. l'. <The
poet means. that of course. the man
never went near 1110111 at all, but
lived on borrowing.)

10. contra] mz‘rnv‘rmpf, right
over against the Forum ,lulit-
scripsts, &c.‚ ‘with both its door—
posts written all over' with the
names of the authors sold within.
This curious custom is perhaps 111011-
tioned only here. lt was a. ready
advertisement, and could be con-
sulted without entering the shop.

13. illino] Viz. from the lists on
the door-posts—m’c rosses, ι(1011“1
ask the owner of the shop, Ati-ectus*
(Atrestus? ἄτρεστος), viz. whether
he keeps martial in his stores.
He pretends to show how the man
may save himself trouble. Or per-
haps (though this is a less common
use of1·ogs‹m·e)‚ ‘ don't ask for Atrec-
tus' (i. 0 where he lives), ‘for his
name is written up outside.'

15. nido] The couipnrtment or
piston-hele 111 which MS. books
were kept. Cf. Ep. 333. 5, ‘hos
nido licet inseras vel i1n0.' Hence
it appears that the ⁶ first or second '

and the poet thereby intimatos that
his epigrams were in nequest—ra-
