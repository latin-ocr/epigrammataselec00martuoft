Ah pudet ingratae, pudet ah male divitis areae.
Quod non das equiti, vis dare, Praetor, equo?

ΕΡ. 201. (iv. lxviii.)

The poet complains that Sextus invitcd him to a poor dinner at 100
quadrantes, and yet had a good dinner himself. The argument of this
epigram is often repeated, as in Ep. l3; 233 iii. 49, and many others.

Invitas eentum quadrantibus et bene cenas,
Ut cenem invitor, Sexte, au ut invideam?

ΕΡ. 202. (IV. lxix.)

Pzipilus was famed for the quality of his wine, but at the same time he
had been a. widower four times, so that a repert got about that his wines
were poisoned. Martial says, that of course he does not ‘think or believe
this to be a fact3 neverthelcss, he is not athirst, i.e. he will not risk his
life by drinking from that flask.

Tu Setina quidem semper vel Massica ponis,
Papile, sed rumor tam bona vina negat.
Diceris hae factus caelebs quater esse lagona.

Nee puto, nee eredo, Papile, neo sitio.

EP. 203. (IV. lxx.)

Ammianus, a spendthrift, had been eagerly looking out for his father's
death to inherit his property ; bnt he knowing it, revoked his former will,
and in his last (ultimis ceris) left him nothing buta rope to hang himself.
“who would have thought,” says MartiaL “that Ammianus would be
esox-r),¹ for his father's death?” (Perhaps there is a sly emphasis on the
name.) ‘ ploratur lacrymis amissa pecunia veris‚' as Juvenal says.

Nihil Ammiano praeter aridam restem
Moriens reliquit ultimis pater ceris.
Fieri putaret posse quis, Marulline,
Ut Ammianus mortuum patrem nollet?
