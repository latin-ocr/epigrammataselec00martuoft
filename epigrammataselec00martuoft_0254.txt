:2⁶28 M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Et poscat dare, quae dei potestis:
Nil pro me mihi, Iuppiter, petenti 5
Ne succensueris velut superbo.

Te pro Caesare debeo rogare:
Pro me debeo Caesarem rogare.

5. Nil—milzi—petmzli] Quia nil with me as one too proud to ask a
pro me ipso petam. ‘ Do not be angry blessing on myself,' διο.

ΕΡ. 365. (VII. lxi.)

It appears that at Rome small shopkeepers‚ bai-bers, &c., had been
accustomed to expose their wares for sale in the street, and block up tho
way with them. Small booths were also erected in front otheir shops for
the same purpose. So Suet. Ner. 26, says, ⁴ Nero circa vicos vagabatur
ludibundus-tabernulas etiam effringere et expilare ;' with which compare
Tac. Ann. xiii. 25, ‘itinera urbis pererrabat comitantibus qni raperent
nd venditionem exposita.' This hwd grown to be such a nuisance, that
Germanicus Caesar (Domitian) forbade it entirely, and is here praised by

Mau tial for his good offices in clearing the streetS.

Abstulerat totam temerarius institor urbem
Inque sno nullum limine limen erat.

Iussisti tenues, Germanice, crescere vicos,
Et modo quae fuerat semita, faeta via est.

Nulla catenatis pila est praecincta lagonis, 5
Nec praetor medio cogitur ire luto;

1. institor] ‘ Huckster‚' Ep. 669.
14. Generully one who trades for
another, much as our commereial
tlavellers; here apparently any small
petty trader.

2.] ⁶ Every threshold was extended
beyond itself‚' i.e. the shop stretched
out beyond its just proportions into
the streete.

3. ,lassis-ti, &eff ⁶ You ordered the
narrow streets to be widened, and so,
what was lately only a pathway, has
been made a road.‘

4. semita] A footpath, opposed to
via, the high road. These terms are
often contrasted, as in the proverb,
Plaut. Casin. iii. 5. 40, ‘Sciens de
via in semitam deg1·adere;' and that
preserved by Cicero, De Div. i. 58.
‘ Qui sibi semitam non sapiunt,
alteri manstrant viam) Varro de-
rives the word from ‘semiterss a

half and so small way ; it is opposed
to ‘ callis,' as a small but level path
to a ru}r ed sheep—track. Virg. Aen.
xi. 382, ‘ Rara per occultos ducebat
semita calles!

5.] ‘ No tavern-post is gii-t in fiont
with pots chained to its The pots
were hung out to show the trade, but
chained on to prevent theft, like the
ladles in modern drinking-fountains.
—pila is used equivalent to ‘ ta-
bcrna‚' in Catullus 37. l, ‘ taberna--
a pileatis nona fratribus pila‚' ‘nine
doors from the temple of Castor and
Pollux? On this ‘ pila' booksellers ⁷
hung advertisements of their books
(cf. Ep. 62. ll), and round it ex
posed them for sale. Hor. Sat. i.
4. 71, ‘ Nulla taberna meos habeat

rliggue1 pila libellos.‘-luto‚ see Ep.
