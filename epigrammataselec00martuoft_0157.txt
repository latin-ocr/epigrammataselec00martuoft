Vilica vel duri compressa est nupta coloni,
’ Incaluit quotiens saucia vena mero.
Nec nocuit tectis ignis, nec Sirius agris,
Nec mersa est pelago, nec fluit ulla ratis.

Supposita est blando nunquam tibi tessera talo,

Alea sed parcae sola fuere nuces.
Die, ubi sit deciens, mater quod avara reliquit?
Nusquam est: fecisti rem, Line, difficilem.

14. nec fluit] ‘ You have not even
got a ship at sea that can be sunk.'

15. tessera talo] The talus (ἀστρά-
γαλος) had only four numbers on
it, the tessera (κύβος) six3 but four
mli were used at once, and only two
or three tesserae. So xiv. 15, ⁴ Non
sim talomm numero par tessera, dum
sit Major, quarn talis, alea saepe
mihi) For the tessera was always
played for money3 not so the talus,
the prize of the winner in which
was often‚ as here, a handful of nuts.
Cf. Ov. Nux. 75, ⁴ Quatuor in nuci-
bus, non amplius, alea tota est Cum
sibi suppositis additur una tribus?
Ins. xiv. 18, ‘Alea parva nuces et
non damnosa videtur3' though some-

times even this was used for gain-
bling. Cf. Suet. Aug. 71. ‘Talis
jactatis, ut quisque canem aut seni-
onem miserat, in singulos talos sin-
gulos denarios in medium cquferebat,
quos tollebat universos, qui Venerem
jecerat.' — snyfflosita, ‘ substitutcd
forst-blando, enticing. Cf. Ep.
56. 3; 165. ὃς 272. 3; 690. 5, ‘ non

talo.

17. deciens] ‘Centena millia: the

Ρ18. άζίῖἰεὶἶενιῑ] He intimates that
foul means must have been employed
in getting through such a fortune.

ΕΡ. 200. (iv. lxvii.)

At Rome the patron often made up the census equestris for his client when
he wanted but little of it (see Ep. ⁶234); here the poet introduces one
Gaurus, petitioning his patron for a hundred sesterces to make up the 40⁴)
necessary3 but his suit is unsuceessful. as the praetor pleads that he has to
give large sums of money to certain charioteers to pay for equestrian statut-s
to be erected in their honour. The poet thereupon blames him for being
willing to give to the horse and not to the knight. Cf. Ep. 234. 9.

Praetorem pauper centum sestertia Gaurus
Orabat cana notus amicitia,
Dicebatque suis haec tantum deesse trecentis,
Ut posset domino plaudere iustus eques.
Praetor ait “ Scis me Scorpo Thalloque daturum, 5
Atque utinam centum milia sola darem.”
4. Domino] sc. Domitiano, when 5. Scorpo Thalloque] Famous cha-
hc entered the theatra-justusque& rioteers. Scorpus is mentioned Ep.
