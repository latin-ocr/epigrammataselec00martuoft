EPIGRAMMATA.

Rerum certa salus, terrarum gloria, Caesa-r,
Sospite quo magnos eredimus esse deos,
Si festinatis totiens tibi lecta libellis
Detinuere oeulos earmina nostra tuos,
Quod fortuna vetat fieri, permitte videri, 5
Natorum genitor credar ut esse trium.
Haec, si displicui, fuerint solatia nobis;
Haec fuerint nobis praemia, si placui.

l. certa] On whom we rely with
confidence, as serzator civilem. —-
sospite, ‘whose preservation to us is
itself³ proof osihe existence of the

pretium, &c. ιε an acknowledgment

my poems.

3. zedebis] ‘I will have nothiucr
further to do with you, wife3 it Ι

have three children by you, the
privilege of the Emperor will he
thrown away,' viz. because it will
then become a riylct. From lib. xi.
104, it would seem that the poet did
not much like his first wife.

ΕΡ. 109. (ΠΙ. i.)

The poet addresses the render, to whom he sends his third book from
Forum Cornelii (inf. Ep. lll), in Gallia Cisalpina, or Togata.

Hoc tibi quidquid id est longinquis mittit ob oris
Gallia Romanae nomine dieta togae.

Hune legis et laudas librum fortasse priorem:
Illa vel haee mea sunt, quae meliora putas.

3. hunc lestis, &c] The meaning
