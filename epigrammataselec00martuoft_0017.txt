at the eost of his independence4. ‘Quid si per quin-
decim annos,' asks Tacitus⁵, ‘ grande mortalis aevi
spatium, multi fortuitis casibus, promptissimus quisque
saevitia principis, interciderunt? Pauci, ut ita dixerim,
non modo aliorum sed etiam nostri superstites sumus,
exemptis e media vita tot annis, quibus juvenes ad
senectutem, senes prope ad ipsos exactae aetatis ter-
minos per silentium venimus? Like Tacitus, Martial
lived to see, and wrote to praise, the happier reigns of
Nerva and Trajan. If Martial was a sensualist, he was
a Roman among Romans that lived the same lives them-
selves, and praised and bought epigrams bearing most
undisguisedly on the fashionable vices ⁶. But in Martia]
we have a great mixture of the bad with the good. If
We have placed the latter in the hands of the young with-
out the fear of scandal from the former, Ι think that we
shall have served in some degree the cause of Roman
literature.

It only remains to add, that we have adopted in this
edition the excellent and carefully revised text of F. G.
Schneidewin (Teubner, 1853), which, being founded on a ·
collation of all the best MSS„ is as good a one as ean be
obtained, or even desired. In three or four places, per-

haps, we have ventui-ed slightly to modify the punctuation.

the necessary condition, he says, of epigram-writing. ‘Sic scribit
Catullus, sie Marsus, sie Pedo, sie Gaetulicus, sic quicunque perle-
gitur! (Proem. ad lib. 1.)
