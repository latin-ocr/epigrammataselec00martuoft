M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Pinguis et implicitas virga teneret aves:

Care, daret sollemne tibi cognatio munus, 5
Nec frater nobis, nec prior esset avus,

Nunc sturnos inopes fringillorumque querellas
Audit ct arguto passere vernat ager.

Inde salutatus picae respondet arator,

Hinc prope summa rapax milvus ad astra volat.

10

Mittimus ergo tibi parvae munuscula chortis,
Qualia si recipis, saepe propinquus eris.

4. Pinyuis] Rendered sticky with
birdlime.

5. Care appears to be a proper
name, as in Ep. 458.—sollemne, ⁸ cus—
tomary on such occasions,' when
ytt⁷1aejrobably was the usual present.
Cf. 414. 1. Οι·, ‘1 would have sent
them to you as a gift on this anni-
versa1·y.'

7. Nunc. δια] ‘As it is. my estate
produces nothing but wxld singing-
birdsf-sturnos, ‘ starhngsss which
are called inopes, because they have
nothing worth giving—fringilli are
thought to be ‘ chaffinchesf-vernat,
a rare but classical word, used by
Propert. v. 5. 59, ⁶ dum vernat san-
guis, dum rugis integer annus.’ Com-

ΕΡ. 474.

pare ‘ hibernatque meum mar&
Pei-s. vi. 7. The word has reference
to the season of the Caristia being
early spring—amulo, ¹ twitte1·ing‚'
ις]ιίι·ρὶῃὲ,’ Ep. 148. 13.

9. lude] ⁴ On one side? The jay
(or magpic) croaks to the rustic, who
tries to imitate and return its greet-
ὠμὴ-[ΕΜ prope, ⁴ from the other
side close at hand.' The kite has
been making a descent on the chick-
ens by the farm-house. The enume-
ration of wild birds is continued, but
such only as are not used for food.

ll. chortis] See Epp. 343, 13 617.
l4.—sc1epe propinquus, ‘ you shall
often be treated b? me in the same
way, as a relation.

(ix. lv.)

On the same subject3 but an excuse for sending a present to neither of
his two special friends, lest others should be offended. This epigram is
addressed to Valerius Flaccus, the author of the Λιῃοηααίιέα. Both he
and Stella, the wealthy Eques and poet, would seem to have been in some

way related to Martial.

Luce propinquorum, qua plurima mittitur ales,
Dum Stellae turdos, dum tibi, FIacce, paro,
Occurrit nobis ingens onerosaque turba,

In qua se primum quisque meumque putat.

1. Luaee propinquorum] ‘On the
day of the Caristia' (sup. 473). ⁸ In
thinking of sending field-sares to
Stella and Flaccus, I recall to mind
a great number of persons. everv one

of whom considers himself my porti-
cular friend, and claims 1'elationsh1p.'

-onerosa‚ i. e. ‘ quibus dona mittere
onerosum fue1·it.'
