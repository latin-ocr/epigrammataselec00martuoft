ΕΡ. 458. (IX. xxm.) ¹

To 0110 Carus, who had placed 3 goldeu olive-crown, won at the
Quinquatria, on the head ofa marble bust of Domitian.

Ο eui virgineo flavescere contigit auro,
Dic ubi Palladium sit tibi, Care, decus?

“Aspicis en domini fulgentes marmore voltus?
Venit ad has ultro nostra corona eomas.’'

5 6.] The comment of the poet.
‘Then the oaken crown (see Ep.
446 8) may well be jealous of the
olive of Pallas (who was worshipped
by Domitian at Alba, Ep. 160p 5),
because that (the latterp) has been
the first to encircle au unconquered

a symbol servati civis, aud is thus
called patriotic, or fond of the
people..

ΕΡ. 459. (IX. xxvi.)

This epigram, like 437, pays a compliment to the poetic powers of

Nerva.

The poet says that to send his verses to such a writer is aa

superfluous as to send roses to Paestum.
