ΕΡ. 122. (111. xvi.)

On a rich but ambitious shoemaken who had ruined himself by giving
thow of gladiators, probably at Bologna; see inf. iii. 59, *Sutor ccx-110
dedit tibi, culta Bononia, munus, Fullo dedit Mutinae: nunc ubi copo

dabit ? '
158.

For the wealth acquired by cobblers, see Ep. 484: also Ep.

Das gladiatores, sutorum regule, cerdo,
Quodque tibi tribuit subula, siaa rapit.

Ebrius es: neque enim faceres hoe sobrius unquam,
Ut velles corio ludere, cerdo, tuo.

Lusisti corio: sed te, mihi crede, memento 5
Nune in pellicula, cerdo, tenere tua.

l. regule, &c.] ‘You cobbler-
priuce of shoemakers.' The com-
hination is the more pointed, because
cerdo (κέμδωιι) was a terni for the
lowest kind of tradesman ς see Pers.
iv. 51, ‘tollat sua munera cerdo ς’
JuV. iv. 1⁵33 viii. lss2-qzcodqzae,
&c.,‘and what you gained by the
awl, you have lost by the gladiator's
knife,‘ i. e. by the lives sacrificed
in the amphitheatre. For sica, a
sharp-pointed and curved knife‚ see
Rich's Dict. in v.

4. corio ludere] These words an
ambiguously used, (l) for [tulo con-
sumere 01·perdere; (2) in allusion to
the proverb ‘ de alieno corio libe-
ralis& i. e. impensa aliena. Compare
vii. lO. 2, ⁴ Ole, quid ad fe, De cutc
quid faciant ille vel ille suaF' Of
course, there is also an allusion to
the leathcr used in the trade. So
also in pellis-ala, which at the same
time refers to the fable of the ass
in the lion's skin, and to the proverb
‘ Ne sutor ultm c1·epidam.'

ΕΡ. 123. (ΠΙ. xviii.)

Perfrixisse tuas questa est praefatio fauces.
Cum te excusaris, Maxime, quid recitas?
