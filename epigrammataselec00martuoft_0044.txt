M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Procul horridus Liburnus et querulus cliens,
Imperia viduarum proeul3

Nou rumpet altum pallidus somnum reus,

Sed inane totum dormies.
Mereatur alius grande et insanum sophos·

Miserere tu felicium

Yoroque fruere non superbus gaudio,

Dum Sura laudatur tuus.

Nou impudenter vita. quod relicum est petit,
(lum fama quod satis est habet.

aud frequently¹ in Martial, e. g. iv,
4. 6, ‘redolet—quod bis murice
vellus inquinatum ς’ aud Ep. 73. 3.

perhaps in a moral sense, ⁴ causing
di·ead‚‘ as we should say ‘ that hom-id
Libui-niun) These men acted as
court-ushers or messengers. See

only nominal prosperity‚ aud perhaps
also with laudatur in the next line,
as the Greeks use ἔργῳ and λόγῳ.
-Βιινα, a friend and perhaps relation
of Licinianus3 at least Pliny writes
to a Licinius Sura, Ep. iv. 30. He
seems to have been a successful
pleader. Others call him I'alphu-
rius Sura. who is mentioned in Juv.
iv. 53. But he seems to have been ⁷
an informer, «lelalor.

41. petit] ‘Seeks for itselfff i.e.
claims to enjoy. When a man has
made a reputation and a fortune, le
may be allowed to enjoy the re-
mainder of life without seeming uu-

Α joke on the verse iu ll. i. 465, μίστυλλόν τ’ ἄρα τᾶλλα καὶ ἄμφ’

ΕΡ. 27. (1. lii.)

The poet to his friend

epigrams as his own.

Quintianus, requesting him to put a stop to a

plagiarist (the Fidentinus of the next Ep),
He speaks of the said epigram-‘³ as held in durance

who was reciting Martial's

vile, like a slave stolen from his rightful master. Compare Ep. 32. 9.

Commendo tibi, Quintiano, nostros—-
Nostros dicere si tamen libellos
