xii LIFE AND WRITINGS

the privileges of the Roman civitas. The gens Valeria
reckoned other pocts of note, among whom were Caius
Valerius Catullus and Caius Valerius Flaccus, the author
of the Aryonautiea. Thc cognomen Martialis may have
reference to the circumstance that he was born on thc
Kalends of March 4. The date of his birth is commonly
placed at A.D. 43; but as 116 calls himself fifty-seven
years old in the tenth book ⁵, which appears to have been
written in Nerva's reign ⁶, A.D. 96-97‚ his birth would
seem to have been somewhat earlier, viz. A.D.·'39—4o.
Though 116 came to Rome at an early age, and com-
menced writing epigrams even as a boy ⁷, hc retained. a
vivid recollection of, and a strong liking for, the pic-
turesque scenery and the easy as well as economical life
that he had enjoyed in his native town. Many epigrams
allude to it, and in one ⁸ we have a description of Bilbilis,
characterized by great feeling and the keenest sense of
the pleasures and beauties of the country.

After a long residence at Rome, he returned ‘an old ’ ¹

man ⁹‚’ as 116 calls himself, to Bilbilis, from which he had
been absent (except, perhaps, in occasional visits) thirty-
four years ¹. At Rome the poet formed a friendship with
many of the illustriousmen and authors of the day—Lucan,
Juvenal, Valerius Flaccus, Pliny the Younger, Quinti-
lian, Statius, Silius Italicus, Sec„ and many others of
wcalth and influence whom he addresses in his epigrams.
