M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Quam uobis cupis esse tu priorem.

Pompeian frescos.

29. tu] This is clearly right. not
le. ‘WVhom you, 1 dare say, desire
to see placed before me,' i. e. prefer
even to your host. There is a play
on prior and sequi, though the exact
point is obscure: ‘She is prior to you,

and you will like her to be prior to
ωε) It would seem as if this, which
is purposely put last, is held out as
the real inducement to Toranius 11
so, the general sense will be ‘The
dinner is a poorone, but then Claudia
will be there.’

ΕΡ. 270. (V. lxxix.)

Zoilus is often ridiculed by Martia] as a mean fellow, who made a display
of his wealth, e.g. in Ep. 73. His Greek Lame indicates that he was

a libertus.

Undeciens una surrexti, Zoile⁷ cena,
Et mutata tibi est synthesis undeciens,

Sudor inhaereret madida ne veste retentus
Et laxam tenuis laederet aura entem.

Quare ego non sudo, qui tecum, Zoile, ceno? 5
Frigus enim magnum synthesis una facin

2. synthesis] See 89. 43 199. 43
693. 1. Α suit of mantles or scarfs,
each of a different shade of Tyrian
dye, and collectively extremely
costly, was called synthesis. See
Becker, Gallus, p. 4213 lib. x. 29, 4,
‘ de nostra prasina est synthesis empta
toga.' On the same principle of
being arranged in sets according to
size, we have ‘septenaria synthesis
Sagunti,' Ep. 186. 15. Becker is
perhaps wrong in saying (p. 422),
that synthesis is ‘also used in alotally
different sense, namely, as an entire
wardrobe, or a suit of com lete appa-
rel.' Synthesis is primari ymeant as
the whole set, and then, as one out
of the number. He thinks the word
came from the folding up of the gar-
ment.

3. Sudor] This was probably a
mere excuse sor changing his dress
so often, the real object being to dis-
play his wealth. Becker, however,
shows (p. 421), from Suet. Nero, ἓ 51,
that under the synthesis a sudarimn
was worn. to intercept the moisturc
which would have sullied the costly
hue.

4. tenuis-aura} The draught sroui
open doors, Sca—lawarn, with the
poresopened by theuse os the hotbath.

6. frz'yus] A chill to my genial
feelings. Pers. i. 108, ‘ videsis majorum
ne tibi forte limina frigescant.’ The
sense is, ⁸ my (me synthesis keeps me
cool,' and that, in a double sense: I
have no fuss in changing, and no one
cares about me. Cf. 199. 4, ‘ duxit
et aestates synthesis una derem.'

ΕΡ. 271. (V. lxxx.)

The poet commende his book to the criticisms of his friends Severus
and Secundus, apologizing for iuterfering with their leisure time.
