Pervius exiguos habitabas ante penates,
Plurima qua medium Roma terebat iter.

Nunc tua Caesareis cinguntur limina donis, 5
Et, fora tot numeras, Iane, quot ora geris.

At tu, sancte pater, tanto pro munere gratus,
Ferrea perpetua claustra tuere scra.

O temperatae dulce Formiae litus,

Vos, cum severi fugit oppidum Martis

Et inquietas fessus exuit curas,

Apollinaris omnibus locis praefert.

Non ille sanctae dulce Tibur uxoris, 5
Nec Tusculanos Algidosve secessus,

Praeneste nec sic Antiumque miratur.

Non blanda Circe Dardanisve Caieta
