Μ. VAL. MARTIALIS

ΕΡ. 347. (VII. xxxvii.)

Some quaestor had arranged that if he blcw his nosce, a condemned crimi-

nal was to be executed3 if not, to bc saved.

Martial laughs at his pcr-

plexity, because once on a cold December day he wanted to wipe- his hose,
and was restrained by his colleague for feai that it might bc mistaken for the

preconccrted signal.

Nosti mortiferum quaestoris, Casu-100, siguum?
Est operae pretium discere theta novum.
Exprimeret quotiens rorantem frigore nasum,
Letalem iuguli iusserat esse notam.
Turpis ab inviso pendebat stiria naso, 5
Cum flaret media fauce December atrox.

Collegae tenuere manus.

Quid plura requiris?

Emungi misero, Castriee, non licuit.

1. quaestoris] Anciently, the qnae-
stores parricidii (duumviri pcr-
duellionis) had the power over the
life and death of accused citizen53
see Livy, i. 263 vi. 20. Ritter ou
Tac. Ann. xi. 22. There is a
difficulty, if the statement here is
seriously meant, in assuming that this
power continued in force so long.

*2* [hela] 'l'he letter θ (θάνατοι)
was prefixed to the names of those

to be executed. Pers. iv, 13, ⁴ et
potis es nigrum vitio praeponere
theta? '

4. Lelalem—notam] The death-
warrant-jzcgyuli, σφαγῆς, i. e. jugu-
landi hominis.

5. stiria] An icicle. Ep. 636. 7,
⁴ nec congelati gutta proderit nasi.'

7. quid plur-<1 2] καὶ τί δεῖ λέγειν;
‘ The end of it was that,' &Q

ΕΡ. 348. (VH. xxxviii.)

On two deformed slaves of Severus, called Polyphemus and Scylla, o(
whom Martia] says they are so like their originals, that each must be an

object of dread to the other.

Monsters of this sort were in great request

at'Rome„ and brought high prices. Augustus (Suet. 83) ‘pumilos atque
distortos ut ludibria naturae malique ominis abhorrebat ς’ nevertheless he

had a court dwarf Canopas.

Tantus es et talis nostri, Polypheme, Severi,
Ut te mirari possit et ipse Cyclops.

Sed nee Scylla minor.

Quod si fera monstra duorum

Iunxeris, alterius fiet uterque timor.

3. nec—minor] Alteri par est.
4. Junavris] viz. by contubernium.

If they marry, they will keep each
other in order by mutual fear.
