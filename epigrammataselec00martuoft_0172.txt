MARTIALIS

Qui legis et tota cantas mea crumina Roma:
Sed0 nescis, quanti stet mihi talis amor.
Nam si fwlcifcri defendere templa '*‹lon tntis 6
Sollicitisque velim vendere verba reis,
Plurimus Hispanas mittet mihi nauta metretas
Et fiet vario sordidus aere sinus.
At nunc conviva est comissatorque libellus,
Et tantum gratis pagina, nostra placet. 10
Sed non et veteres contenti laude fuerunt,
Cum minimum vati munus Alexis erat.

‘⁶ Belle''

inquis ‘⁶ dixti: iuvat, et laudabimus usque.’'

Dissimulas? facies me, puto, causidicum.

‘non prosint sane, me tamen ista
juvant?

5. fczf'cifhri—Tonanlis] The tem-
ple of Saturn‚ on the slope of the
Capitol, and near the Forum Ro-
manum. The image of Satum with
his knife (our Father Time with his
scythe) was said to have been im-
ported into Rome in early times.
Ovid, Fast. i. 233, ‘Tuscum rate
venit in amnem Ante pererrato
falcifer orbe deus. ' ⁴ To defend his
templess meiely means ‘to plead m
the forum) much as Horace says,
‘obeundus Marys ιι, 'Sat i. 6 120.

9, conviva] My book is only read
at banquets and drunken revela,
and pleases only when there is
nothing to be paid for hearing it.
A ‚quest does not pay for his dinner.

looked for something more sub-
stantial than mele pxaisess e. g. the
present of ιι handsonie slave· bov at
the vely least.—-Aleazs Virg. Ecl.
ii. 1; Prop e1·.t iii. 26 73.

l3. ] Y ou say, ‘You are a capital
poet. We like you, and will ever
gne you exedit for that) Martial
means this to be ιι r·ep100f and ιι
hint that it is only barren praise3

to understand my meaning? You
