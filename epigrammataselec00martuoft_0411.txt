EPIGRAMMATA.

Ati eus Caecilius cucurbitarum
Sic illas quasi filios Thyestae

In partes lacerat secatque mille.
Gustu protinus has edes in ipso,
Has prima feret alterave cena,
Has cena tibi tertia reponet.
Hinc seras epidipnidas parabit,
Hine pistor fatuas facit placentas,
Hine et multiplices struit tabellas
Et notas caryotidas theatris ;
Hinc exit varium coco minutal,

Ut lentem positam fabamque credas:

Boletos imitatur et botellos,

Et caudam cybii brevesque maenas:
Hinc cellarius experitur artes,

Ut condat vario vafer sapore

In rutae folium Capelliana.

l.] ‘Caecilius, the Atreus of
ἔσω-(15, cuts them up as the real
Atreus did the children of his bro-
ther Thjestesf More than that,
he disgui' es them by the art of the
cook, as the flt 11 of the children were
ᾶσημ 1‹1(Aesch Ag. 1596), difficult to
dist inguish.

4. Gustu] Dishes to excite the
appetite, and promote the digestion,
that were brought on before the
regular caena, such as are mentioned
in xii. 19, lactucas, ova, &zoor-tum.
Cf. Epp. 269. 3-53 545. 7—12.
After this came the ‘mensae pri-
mae‚' divided into vanous ‘fei-cula:
‘courses‚' as here are mentioned,
‘prima, altera, tertia. caena? In
Juv. i. 94, we read of even ‘ fercula
septem? Then came the ‘mensae
secundae' of fruit, sweetmeats,
⁴ bellaria,' and dishes made only to
be looked at, ‘ epideipnides: as here,
Petron. 69. 6.

8. fatuas] ‘ Tasteless.' So xiii. 13,
‘fatuae—betae.' Cf. 537. 9.

9. struit] Not the pistor, but the
structor, who, however, in Caecilius*
house may have been represented
by one and the same person: part of

his business was to construet arti-
ficial figures and ‹lishes for the
dessert to which this alludes.

16.] The cellarius seems to have
had the duty ofsupplying such viantis
as would improve the flavour of the
wine. Here he appears to have
mixed mashed gourd with several
kinds of sance or condiment made
by Capella, an unknown artiste, and
to have inserted them within a leaf
of the bitter rue-plant, something
after the sashion of the Gieek
θρῖον. SeeonEp. 78. 5.
