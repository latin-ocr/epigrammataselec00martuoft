patron of Martial's. Compare Ep. 217.

Parthenio dic, Musa, tuo nostroque salutem 3
Nam quis ab Aonio largius amne bibit?

Cuius Pimpleo lyra clarior exit ab antro?
Quem plus Pierio de grege Phoebus amat?

Et si forte, sed hoc vix est sperare, vacabit, 5

ΕΡ. 645. (XII. xiv.)

The poet warns his friend Priscus Terentius against rashness in hunting.

Parcius utaris, moneo, rapiente veredo,
Prisce, nec in lepores tam violentus eas.

Saepe satisfecit praedae venator, et acri
Decidit excussus, nec rediturus, equo.

Insidias et campus habet: nec fossa, nec agger, 5
Nec sint saxa licet, fallere plana solent.

The origin of the word is unknown, που redituras, through being killed
and it is of scant occurrencc. Cf. by the fall.
