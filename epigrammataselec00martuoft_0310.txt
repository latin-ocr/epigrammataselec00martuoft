Crete.

Haec, (111110 tota patet tegiturque et marmore et auro,
Infantis domini conseia terra fuit.
Felix 0 quantis sonuit vagitibus et quas
Vidit reptantes sustinuitque manus!

7. Curetes, &c.] By rattling their
armour-suvh armour as the eunuch

207, 'Ardua jam (1111111111 resonat
tinnitibus Ida, Tutus ut infanti
vagiat ore puer. Pars clipeos sudi-
bus, galeas pars tundit inanes3 Hoc
Curetes habent, hoc Corybantes
