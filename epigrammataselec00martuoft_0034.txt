8 M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Non est, erede mihi, sapientis dicero “ Vivam :''
Sera nimis vita est crastiua : vive hodie.

11. vivam] The point turns on
the termination; ‘a wise man will

say vivo, not merely vivam?

ΕΡ. 11. (1. xvii.)

A reply to on(= who recommended the Profession os a pieader as more

Cogit me Titus actitare causas
Et dicit mihi saepe, “Magna res ests
Res magna est, Tite, quam facit colonus.

23. res 7›1a5172a,&c.] ‘ If mere profit and honour should be considered, as
is the question, it pays to be a. wellas mere money.

farmch He intimatas that credit

ΕΡ. 12. (1. xviii.)

011 a stingy host, who mixed bad wine with good in order to make it go

furiher.

Quid te, Tucca, iuvat vetulo miscere Falerno
111 Vaticanis condita musta cadis ἲ
Quid tantum fecere boni tibi pessima vina ?
Aut quid fecerunt optima vina mali Ρ
De nobis facile est, scelus est iugulare Falernum 5

cernae 9·

5.] filcile, εὐχερὲς, εὐμαρὲς, a
matter of indiffcreuce. ‘ l don't so
much care about the guests being
ill—treated3 but it z's a sin to murder
Falernian, and to add deadly poison
to the contents of a Campaniau wine-

jar.' So in Ep. 536. 4, bad wine
from Marseilles is termed {mica
saera.

7.] perire, to be poisoned. Per-
haps he :illudes to the not very re-
putable society at Tucca's table. So
mori in the next line refers to 0110
wine being poisoned by the other
