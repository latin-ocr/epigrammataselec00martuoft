TO THE READER..

THE notes in the present edition of Martial were for the
most part written in the years 1862—1863. My late-
]ainented friend and former pupil, ΜΓ. Stone, scholar of
Trinity Collcge‚ had consented to join mein the attempt
(no light one, we were well aware) to produce such an
edition of this poet as might be found suitable both for
school reading and for general use. Hc entered into his
work with great enthusiasm, and devoted much time and
labour to his allotted portion of the task. An excellent
and promising scholar, and a keen admirer of Martial,
whom he justly regarded as the greatest wit as wel] as
the most accomplished and artistic versifier of antiquity‚
he had not only made himself master of his author, but
he had read a good deal for the express purposes of illus-
tration and explanation. His notes were placed in my
hands, after his early decease, not indeed fully finished,
nor as hc himself intended them for publication, yet in
such an advanced state that I have been able to avail
*nysclf ofthcm as far as they went.
