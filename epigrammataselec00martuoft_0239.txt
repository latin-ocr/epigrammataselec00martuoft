EPIGRAMMATA. 213

ΕΡ. 340. (VII. xxvi.)

Martial commends his book to Apollinaris (cf. Ep. 212. 531), saying,
that if he favours it, it need not sear the malice of others.

Apollinarem conveni meum, Scazon,

Et si vac-abit, ne molestus accedas,

Hoc qualecunque, euius aliqua pars ipse est,

Dabis: hoe facetae carmen imbuant aures.

Si te receptum fronte videris tota, 5
Noto rogabis ut favore sustentet.

Quanto mearum, scis, amore nugarum

Flagret: nec ipse plus amare te possum.

Contra malignos esse si voles tutus,

ΕΡ. 341. (VII. xxvii.)

A large boar having been sent as a present to Martial by his friend
Dexter, he returns thanks, but sends it back. ou the plea that the cooking
of it would be too expensive for his small kitchen.
