To Marcus Antonius Primus of Toulouse (see Epp. 503, 525), with thankn

for a letter and the present osa toga.

Littera facundi gratum mihi pignus amici
Pertulit, Ausoniae dona superba togae,

Qua non Fabricius, sed vellet Apicius uti,
Vellet Maecenas Caesarianus eques.

Vilior haee nobis alio mittente fuisset: 5
Non quacunque manu victima caesa lita-t.

A te missa venit.

Possem nisi munus amare,

Marce, tuum, poteram nomen amare mcum.
Munere scd plus est et nomine gratius ipso

Officium docti iudiciumque viri.

ἱ.) Ausoniae] ltalian3 those from
Frauce were probably of a coarser
tngtu're, as may be iuferred from Ep.

3. Fabricius] The Censor, who
was proverbial for his rigid simpli-
city; see JuV. xi. 91, and Mr.
Mayor's note—Apicius, ¹ miser et
f1·ugi.'as Juvenal ironically calls him,
iv. ⁸23,was equally a type of extrava-
gance and luxury. See Ep. 127.

4. eques] The favourite title of
Maecenas, who is called Caesarianus
as having attached himself to the side
of Octavian. He was particular in
wearing only the best clothes. Cf.
Juv. xii. 39, ‘vestem (i. e. tunicam)
purpuream, teneris quoque Mae-
cenatibus aptam‚⁸ where Mr. Mayor
cites the present passage.

it; it is not every hand that offers a
victim pleasing to the gods,' but only
‘immunis aram si tetigit manus,' «Sao.
The meaning is. that as not every
victim or offeringpropitiates the. gods.
so not every present is graciously or
thankfully accepted. - qma-unque,
quavis; Ep. i. l.

7. A tel Emphatie—Possermac..
‘ if I could not regard the gift, 1
could have regarded the name of [lic
donor, nsaw-us, whi‹·h lie holds in
common with niyselfi' Lit. ⁴ if l
could not have liked your gift. I could
at least have liked my own name.'—
ηιει, Sl mmus.

9. plus est, δια] But moro than
the gift. and more prized than the
name, is the attention shown me, and
the appreciation of my verses by a
learned lmanss He is called facund us
in ver. .
