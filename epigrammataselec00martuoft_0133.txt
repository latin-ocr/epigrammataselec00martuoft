EPIGRAMMATA.

Curre, sed instructus: comitetur Punica librum 5
Spongia: muneribus convenit illa meis.

Non possunt nostros multae, F ausano, liturae
Emendare ioeos: una litura potest.

5. curre, ἂρ] ‘Let a spon e go
with it to obliterate it if wort iless.
For the Punica spongia, cf. Pliny,
N. H. ix. 45. Aesch. Ag. 1329,
βολαῖς ὑγρώσσων σπόγγος ὤλε-
σεν γραφήν.

7.] Many erasions cannot emend
my epigrams, one final one can, viz.
wiping them all out at once (ἀφά-

νισις). Cf. Ep. 159. 3, and ’2. 9.

ΕΡ. 163.

On the rebelliou of L. Antonius Saturninus in Upper Get-many.

Ep. 492.

Hence the joke in Suet. Aug. 85,
Tragoediam magno impetu exorsus
non succedenti stylo abolevit, quae-
rentibusque amicis, quidnam Ajax
ageret, respondit, Ajcwem saum in
sponyiam incidisses Il». Calig. 20,
‘eos, qui maxime displicuissent,
scripta, sua spongia linguave delere
jussos.

(IV. xi.)

Dum nimium vano tumefactus nomine gaudes
Et Saturninum te pudet esse, miser,
Impia Parrhasia movisti bella sub ursa,
Qualia qui Phariae coniugis arma tulit.
Excideratne adeo fatum tibi nominis huius, 5
Obruit Actiaci quod gravis ira freti?

1. vano winzine] In the accident
of being called hy the sanie name
as Antony the Triuinvir. L. An-
tonius Saturninus. ineited. as Au-
relius Victor tells us, ‘Domitiani
saevitia et verborum injuriis,5
stirred up a sedition against Do-
mitian in Germany, the province
allotted to him. He was speedily
overpowered and captured, owing
partly to a sudden innndation from
the Rhine, which prevented his
barbarian allies from joining him.
Cf. Suet. Doni. G. Mm-tivl llere
jestingly ascribes his rebellion to
the pride he felt in his name
Antonius, as if he wished to follow
the example of his great namesake,
and augurs his defeat from the ill
omen attached to the name.

2. Saturninum] You are not eon-
tent to be a Saturninus (referring

probably to the Saturninus who
was tribune, and, as Tacitus calls
him, Ann. iii. ¹27, ‘turbator ple-
bisss who was condemned for seditious
practices, and exeeuted A.U.C. 645);
but you wish to be higher than
that, an Antony, a master of the
world.

3. Parrhasia] In Northern Ger-
many. Ovid calls the constellation
of the Great Bear ‘Parrhasides
stellae? Fast. iv. 577, i. e. Arcadian,
from Callisto, — Phariae conjzcyis,
the Egyptian Cleopatra. Virg. Aen.
viii. (5833, ‘sequiturque (nefas !)
Aegyptia conjux.'

5. exciderat] Sc. animo—hnjzcs,
Antoni.—yravis ira, see Propert.
v. G. 47, ‘nec tc quod classis cen-
tenis remigat alis, Terreat: invito
labitur illa mari.q
