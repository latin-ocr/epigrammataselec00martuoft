M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Cum sole et astris cumque luce Romana.

Invicta quidquid condidit manus, caeli est.

Rome. The poet uses words adapted
to the concluding sentiment: ‘what-
ever has been founded by an uncon-

quered hand, belongs to heaven: i. e.
partakes of its nature and attributes,
and therefore is equally lasting.

(IX. iii.)

An exaggerated compliment to Domitian for his services to the gods in

founding and restoring teniples.

Quantum iam superis, Caesar, caeloque dedisti
Si repetas et si creditor esse velis,
Grandis in aetherio licet auctio fiat Olympo
Coganturque dei vendere quidquid habent:
Conturbabit Atlas, et non erit uncia tota, 5
Decidat tecum qua pater ipse deum.
Pro Capitolinis quid enim tibi solvere templis,
Quid pro Tarpeiae frondis honore potest?
Quid pro culminibus geminis matrona Tonantis?

Pallada praetereo: res agit illa tuas.

2. Si repetas] If you should wish
to get back what you have given, and
should choose to become a creditor,
i. e. to consider your gifts merely in
the light of loans.

3. Grandis—auctio] A great or
general sale. ⁸ Though the gods should
sell all they have, the whole heavenly
host. with the heaven itself borne on
the shoulders of Atlas, will become
baukrupt, and Jupiter himself will
not have a full uncia out of every (ις
(i. e. not one-twelfth of the amount
you have given him) wherewith to
compound wi th youforyourclaims.'—
Dec-idere is ‘ to dispose osa matter)
‘to come to ternis? Cic. in Verr. ii. 3.
48, ⁶ in jugera singula ternis medini-
nis decidere? Juv. xii. 33, ⁴ drcidere
jactu Coepit cum ventisf—Fm· con-
turbare see Ep. 341. 103 Mayor on
JuV. vii. 129.

8. potest] Viz. Jupite1·.-templis‚
the temple (or perhaps temples, viz.

lo

of Capitolinus and Tonans, Ep. prae-
ced. ver. 5) ofthe Capitol restored or
rebuilt by Domitian after being bumt
down. Suet. Doni. ξ 5, ‘Plurima et
amplissima opera incendio absumpta
restituit; in quis et Capitolium, quod
rursus arserat ' (it had been twice
burnt before.and rebuilt first by Sylla,
then by Vespasium).—T‹zrpt²z'aefi·on-
(lis, the querna corona, which was
hung on the Capitol as well as on the
Palatium. See Ep. 191, ]; 444. 7.

9. matrona] ⁶ that shall Juno pay
you for the two temples dedicated in
her honourP' This event does not
appear to be so expressly recorded
elsewhere.

10. Fallacia] See Ep. lGO. 5. As
Pallas was the tutelary goddess of
Domitian, she is said to be specially
concerned with his fortunes, and to
manage his affairs3 so that this ‹god-
dess would be repaying herself out οῖ’
the revenues which she administer-s.
