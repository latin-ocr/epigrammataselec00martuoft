M. VAL. MARTIALIS

ΕΡ, 538. (X. xxxix.)

On an old and ugly woman, who, perhaps, concealed 1101 real age.

Consule te Bruto quod iuras, Lesbia, natam,

Mentiris.
Sic quoque mentiris.

Nata es, Lesbia, rege Numa?
Namque, ut tua saecula narrant,

Ficta Prometheo diceris esse luto.

(X. xli.)

On a rich but avaricious wife, who parted from he'1 husband, lest she
should have to pay the expensos incidental to the office of praetor, to which

he had just been appointed.

Mense novo Iani veterem,

Proeuleia, maritum

Deseris atque iubes res sibi habere suas.
Quid, rogo, quid factum est? subiti quae eausa doloris ?

Nil mihi respondes?

Dicam ego, praetor erat.

Constatura fuit Megalensis purpura eentum ,5
Milibus, ut nimium munera parea dares,

Et populare sacrum bis milia dena tulisset.
Discidium non est hoe, Proeuleia: lucrum est.

forced antithesis between the new
mouth and the old husband.

the people.' The immense expense

incurred by the praetor at these

this means, ‘the general expens es of
