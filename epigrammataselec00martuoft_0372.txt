Μ. VAL. MARTIALIS

(x. xiv.)

To a dissatisfied reader, whom the poet compares to one that has coarto

tastes in eating.

Si quid lene mei dieunt et dulce libelli,
Si quid honorificum pagina blanda sonat,

Hoc tu pingue putas et eostam rodere mavis,
Ilia Laurentis 011111 tibi demus apri.

Vaticana bibas, si delectaris aceto: 5
Νο11 facit ad stomachum nostra lagona tuum.

1.] Lene and dulce are used in re-
ference to food 3 as ‘ vacuis commit-
tere venis nil nisi lene decet; leni
›mecm-dia mulso Prolueris melius‚'
lHor. Sat. ii. 4. 26. It is opposed to
pinque, ⁴ coa1·se‚' ⁵ gross‚' ‘ rich! and
therefore hard to digest. In the 11-
terary sense, any thing pleasing and
soothing is meant; as honore-'ficum
is ‘ complimentary.'

3. costam radere] ‘Yon prefer to
gnaw a rib-bone, though I offer you
the choicest morsels from the 10111 of

a bom-j Cf. Juv. v. 135, ‘ vis, frater,

that like a (log gnawing a bone, this

’κε-0150, would be better than your

monotonous mediocrity.

ΕΡ. 544. (X. xlvii.)

To Julius Martialis (Ep. 198), on the conditions of a happy life.

An

epigram of the highest merit, both in the composition and the matter.

Vitam quae faciant beatiorem,
Iucundissime Martialis, haee sunt:
Res non parta labore, sed relieta3

3. Res, &c.] ‘Property not ac-
quired by toil, but inherited‚¹ viz.
because those who have made money

by their own exertions are apt to put
too high a value on it, aud so not
fully to cujoy its use.
