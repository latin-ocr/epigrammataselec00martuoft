Itur ad Herculeas gelidi qua Tiburis arces
Canaque sulphureis Albula fumat aquis,

Rura nemusque sacrum dilectaque iugera Musis
Signat vicina quartus ab urbe lapis.

Ilio rudis aestivas praestabat porticus umbras, 5
Heu quam paene novum porticus ausa nefas !

Nam subito collapsa ruit, eum mole sub illa
Gestatus biiugis Regulus esset equis.

Nimirum timuit nostras Fortuna querellas,
Quae par tam magnae non erat invidiae.

Nune et damna iuvant ; sunt ipsa pericula tanti ς
Stantia non poterant tecta probare deos.
