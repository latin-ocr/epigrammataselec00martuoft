He ridicules Calpetianus for 1115 ostentation, when ho possesses nothing of

Ponuntur semper chrysendeta Calpetiano
Sive foris, seu eum cenat in urbe domi.
Sic etiam 111 stabulo semper, sic cenat in agro.

Non habet ergo aliud?

why he uses this fine plate 15, not be-
cause he has nothing else, but because
he has nothing of his own; i. e. it 15

Domitian, when starting on his expedition against the Sarmatae or
Daci, had caused a breast- plate to bc made for him similar to the fabled
Aegis of Pallas, whom Domitian held iu particular rev-elence (Ep. 160).
Martial, 111 this and the following epingam lauds it above thc real Aegis.

Accipe belligerae crudum thoraca Minervae,
Ipsa Medusaeae quem timet ira comae.

Dum vacat, haee, Caesar, poterit lorica vocari:
Pectore cum sacro sederit, aegis erit.

1. crudum] Generally taken to
mean ‘ blood-stained,' or with re-
ference to the ancient shields having
been made ofraw hides (Ep. 188. 4).
Rather, it is ‘ unt1·ied‚' ⁴ new„' as 111
Tac. Ann. i. 8, ‘crudum adhuc ser-
vitium.' Stat. Ac. ii. 311,ί crudus
11111201. ’

Ι psa] Which even the mathful
Aegis flinged with Medusaean locks,
fears: or, which would frighten even

the serpents surrounding the Gorgon-
head on Miner'vas shield. See the
excellent article on amis, in Rich· ε
Dict.· , and compare V'iig Aen. viii.
435.
