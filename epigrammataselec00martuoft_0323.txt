l. oliva] The thrush or field-fare
was said to satten on the fruit or

arundo is the fowler's reed an in-
strument so contrived that a sm¹ illel
recd, tipped with birdlime, was sud-

on its perch. To this Zenothenings the
epithet crescente refers, Cf. xiv. 218,
‘non tantum calamis, sed cantu fal-
litur ales, Callida dum tacita crescit
harundo manu) 1t appears from this,
that the fowlcr attracted the atten-
tion of the bird, as he approached it,
by imitating its note. Propertius
