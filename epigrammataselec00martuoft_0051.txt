EPIGRAMMATA.

Inde sacro veneranda petes Pallatia clivo, 5
Plurima qua summi fulget imago ducis.

Nec te detineat miri radiata colossi
Quae Rhodium moles vincere gaudet opus.

Flecte vias hae qua madidi sunt tecta Lyaei

Et Cybeles picto stat Corybante Tholus.

Atriaque excelsae sunt adeunda domus.

Hane pete, nec metuas fastus limenque superbum:
Nulla magis toto ianua poste patet,

Nee propior quam Phoebus amet doctaeque sorores.

l. 3, and v. 9. 3.—sacro cliro, in
compliment to the Emperor, who re-
sided there, as well as for the temple
of the Palatino Apollo.

6.] Plurima imuyo must mean
‘many a statue' of Domitian, and
not 'the huge statue' or colossus
mentioned below, since this latter
was not on the clivus, but in the

where it had been placed hy Nero,

7. detineat] Moretur te, viz. to
gaze on it.—rwlz'ata, with rays round
its head. So the sun is called radi-

temple of Mater Idaea, towards the
upper part of the Palatine and near
the casa Romuli—tholus, the circu-
lar roos, painted, perhaps, internally
with figures of Corybants. Schnei-
dewin reads toras, which does not
give a clear sense. Some think the
figure or statue of a Corybant sur-
mounting the roof is meaut; we ‹lo
not know the exact details of the
temple, but tholus picto Corybante
certainly is most naturally inter-
preted as above.
