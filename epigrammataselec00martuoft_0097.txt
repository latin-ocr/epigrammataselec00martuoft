EPIGRAMMATA.

Nec retro lego Sotaden cinaedum,

Nusquam Graecula quod recantat echo

Nee dictat mihi luculentus Attis

Mollem debilitate galliambon: 5
Non sum, Classice‚ tam malus poeta.

Quid, si per graciles vias petauri

Invitum iubeas subire Ladan?

Turpe est difficiles habere nugas

Et stultus labor est ineptiarum.

2.] Sotades was a lasciviens
Alexandrino poet. for whom the
student may refer ‘to Dr. Smith's
Classical Dict. in v. The allusion
in retro leyo is not certain, as the
poeuis are lost. The meaning pro-
bably is, ‘ that I do not write verses
which will read backwards like the
Sotadean ditties.' (To ‘ read Sotades
backwards,' is to read his verses in
the manner they were intended to
admit of.) Pliny, Ep. v. 2, 3,
‘comoedias audio et specto mimos
et lyricos lego et Sotadicos in-
telligo.' lh. viii. 4. 3, ‘non nullus
et in illo labor, ut barbara et fera.
nomina,--Graecis versibus non re-
sultent.'

3. Graecula echo] The diminu-
tive seems to imply contempt.
The poet is speaking of verses, the
cadence or refinin of which at
the end was consonant with the
beginning of the next. The lines
of George Hei-bert are similar,
“Tem p‚le' 161, ‘O who will show
nie those delights on high? E·cho
I.” “Thou echo, thou art moital,
all men know. Ech03 no. ” Οι
the velsc we call leonine, as‘ ‘Mo-
ribus ornata jacet hic bona. Bertha
Rosata‚'' &c.

4. ἰιωιιίεηίιιε] ‘W ell written.'

The galliambics of Catullus on Ans
or Attis arc very celebmted, and
indeed beautifu13 but from their
meti-e as well as theii subject they
are here called ⁴ effeminate.'

6. non sum, &c.] Because 1 ‹lo
not do all this, I am not therefore
so bad a poet as you think.
