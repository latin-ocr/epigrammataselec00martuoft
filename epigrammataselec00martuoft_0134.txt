The poet prognosticates a happy issue to the marriage of Pudens and
Claudia, from their similarity of disposition and mutual love. It is one
of the most beautiful epigrams of Martial. lf this h(- the Claudia Rufina
of Ep. 618, ‘ peregrina' will mean that she was of British birth.

Claudia, Rufe, meo nubit Peregrina Pudenti:
