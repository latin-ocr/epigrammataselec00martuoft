Non ingratus ager, focus perennis ς

Lis nunquam, toga rara, mens fiuietaq 5
Vires ingenuae, salubre corpus3

Prudens simplicitas, pares amici3

Convictus facilis, sine arte mensa3

Nox non ebria, sed soluta euris3

Non tristis torus, et tamen pudicus3

Semnus, qui faciat breves tenebras:
Quod sis, esse velis nihilque malis3
Summum nec metuas diem, nec optes,

4. ayer] ‘ A farm that yields a good
return, a hearth that is well supplied
throughout the years either with fuel
or victuals. Or both may be included
in the sense in which we should be
said ‘to keep the kitchen-fire going)
-perennz's, ἐπέτειος, ἐπετήσιος.-
imi-atas, Ep. 148. 4.

5. toya rura] ‘The toga seldom
required: either in the service of the
client to the patron, or when one
had to appear in the forum, which no
respectable citizen would do tunica-
tus. For the dislike to the toga, see
Epp. 25. 31 ς 199. 3.

6. Vires inyenuae] ‘ Constitutional
strength,' ἰσχὺς ἐγγενὴς, σύμ-
φυτος. -εἰιηρΙίι-ἰίαε, ‘openness of
character which is too discreet to of-
fend,' by telling unwelcome truths.
So Pliny, Ep. i. 15, ‘ potes appara-
tius cenare apud multos, nusquam
hilarius, simplicius, incautius? —
pares, ‘ congenial,' ‘well-matchcd.'

8. Convictus]‘ Good-natured guests,
a plain table) ‘ By convictus, the
social intercourse of citizens, he
means the friends of your own sta-
tion who frequent your table, and are
at once easy to be pleased and slow
to be offended.-sz'ne arte, without
the elaborate dinners of artistic
cooks, but just such as that described
in the next epi ram.

9. nrm ebria? Not spent in drink-
ing (ι donec iniciet radios in mea
vina dies‚' Propert v. 6, ult), but re-
lievcd from cares by the social cup.

10. Non tristis, δια] Α wife who
is virtuous without being a prude.—
somnus, a sleep so sound that the
dark hours seem to pass quickly.

12. velis] i. e. utvelis, or velle. ‘Tc
be willing to be what you are, and
to refer no other lot.'

3. nec optes] On account of tor-
menting diseases.

ΕΡ. 545. (X. xlviii.)

This, too, is an interesting epigram, containing as it does a minute account
of a plain Roman dinner, to which the poet invites a party of special friends

at an early hour.

Nunciat octavam Phariae sua turba iuvencae

l. Nunciat] See Ep. 435. 1.-ειιιι

performance of the ceremony of the
search for the lost Osiris (Jnv. viii.
39).—juvencae, see Epp. 72. 83 443.
