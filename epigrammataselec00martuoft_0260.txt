M. 'VAL MARTIALIS

ΕΡ. 374. (VII. lxxix.)

Potavi modo consulare vinnm.
Quaeris, quam vetus atque liberale?
Ipso consule conditum: sed ipse,
Qui ponebat, erat, Severe, consul.

l. consulare vinum] Wine, with
a label affixed to it, showing in
whose consulate it was made, such
as the Opimianum, Ep. 15. As only
the best and oldest wines had this
mark, Martial ought to have had a
very good wiue3 but, on the con—
trary, it was that year-'s produce,
and the consul who gave it had his
own name on ‘the bottle. The label

was called titulus. Cf. Juv. v. 33,

‘cujus patriam titulumque senectus
Dclevit3' and Hor. Od. iii. 8. 9,
⁴ Amphorae sumum bibere institutae
Consule 'fullos-liberale, ‘worthy
of a gentleman.'

3. Ipso, &c.] There is a kind of
aposiopesis, or παρ’ ὑπόνοιαν sense,
as if he were going to say, ipso con-
sule Opimio, but afterwards turned
ipso consule into a different sense.

ΕΡ. 375, (VII. lxxx.)

boy ; in return for whom Marcellinus would send a captive from the

Quatenus Odrysios iam pax Romana triones
Temperat et tetricae conticuere tubae,

Hunc Marcellino poteris, Faustine, libellum
Mittere: iam chartis, iam vacat ille iocis.

Sed si parva tui munuscula quaeris amici 5
Commendare, ferat carmina nostra puer:

Non qualis Geticae satiatus lacte iuvencae
Sarmatica gelido ludit iu amne rota,

Sed Mitylenaei roseus mangonis ephebus,

Vel non caesus adhue matre iubente Lacon.

l. Odrysios] A Thracian race,
but a general expression for Nor—
tlaerns, like llyperlmrez'. So in vii.
8. 2, ‘victor ab Odrysio redditur
01 be deus.³ — Quatnnas, quandoqui-
den1.-—lemperat, belli aestum, with
an allusion also tofriqus loci.

3. lllaroellino] tho had been
fighting in the Northern war. Cf.
Ep. 4663 vi. 25, ‘ Marcelline, bonae
soboles sincera parentis, Horrida
Parrhasio quern tegit ursa jug0‚’ &c.

7. lacte] Cf. Ep. 696. 2.-Νοη

qualis, not one of the common

which is run upon the frozen
Danube.

9. roseus, &c.] ‘A rosy-cbeeked
boy, bought from a slave-dealer
from Mitylene,' where the hand-

missus de gente minister.'-Lacon,
δία, alluding to the custom at
