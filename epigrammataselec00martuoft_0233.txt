EPIGRAMMATA.

Te, summe mundi rector et parens orbis: 5
Abesse nostris non tamen potes votis.

Illic et oculis et animis sumus, Caesar,

Adeoque mentes omnium tenes unus,

Ut ipsa magni turba nesciat Circi,

Utrumne currat Passerinus an Tigris. 10

9.] That even the crowds in the currere sensit equos?

Circus do not heed which horse-
chariot is running. Cf. viii. ll. 5,
‘Dum te longa sacro venerantur
gaudia Circo Nemo ‘quater missos

10. Passerinus, &c.] These were
two swift racc-horses of the day.
Ep. 659. 12, ‘Tigrim vince levem-
que Passerinum.'

ΕΡ. 330. (VII. xii.)

Manial here, as elsewhere, assei-ts that he has never maliciously attacked
even his greatest encmies in verse. Some such verses had been ascribed
to him ς but they had been published in his name by a foe to injure him.

Cf. Ep. 509. 534, and on 3. 8.

Sic me fronte legat dominus, Faustine, serena
Excipiatque meoS‚ qua solet aure, iocos,
Ut mea nec iuste quos odit, pagina laesit,
Et mihi de nullo fama rubore placet.
Quid prodest, cupiant cum quidam nostra videri, 5
Si qua Lycambeo sauguine tela madent?
Vipereumque vomant nostro sub nomine virus,
Qui Phoebi radios ferre diemque negant?

l. Sic] On this condidam-qlo-
miuus, Domitian.

3. nec] ‘ Ne eos quidcm‚' as often
in Martial.

4. de nullo, ἃς] ‘ Nec ulla fama
de cujusquam infamia placet mihi ς’
‘Nor do I pride mysclf on credit
gained by putting any one to the
blush.' Or better, perhaps, ‘And
the fame that plcascs me is that
Eihiclh· does not make any one

usi.

5. Quid prodest] that is the use
of my carefulness about this. if you
believe that these productions, that
cannot bear the sunlight‚ are really
mine. Lit.‚ ‘ when some are anxious
that verses should be thought mine,

which] &a

6. Lycambeo] ‘ Of Lycambes‚’
whom Archilochus drove to suicide
by his vii-ulem satire, because he
refused his daughter in marriage to
him. Cf. Ov. Tr. 54, ‘Tincta
Lycambeo sanguine tela dabit?
Hor. Epod. vi. 13, ‘Parata tollo
cornua: Qualis Lycambae spretus
infido gener? and Epist. i. 19. 25.
Compare also inf. Ep. 371. 13.

8, Qui, δια] ‘ Ii qui negant se (vel
recusant), serre lucem‚' ‘who se-
cretly spread verses that they dare
not publish.' The metaphor is well
preserved from the lurking-place of
a Viper.
