Another epigram to the book, commending it to the favourahle notice ol
Julius Cerealis, to whom also Ep. 10. 617 and 658 are addressed. This
was probably written to accompany a copy sent as a present. The formal
dedication to Faustinus in Ep. llO is therefore different.

Vis commendari sine me cursurus in urbem,
Parve liber, mult-is, an satis unus erit?

Unus erit, mihi crede, satis, cui non eris hospes,
