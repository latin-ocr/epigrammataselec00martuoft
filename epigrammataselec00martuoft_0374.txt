MARTIALIS

Et pilata redit iamque subitque cohors.
Temperat haee thermas, nimio prior hora vapore
Halat et immodico sexta Nerone calet.
Stella, Nepos, Cani, Cerealis, Flacee, venitis? 5
Septem sigma eapit3 sex sumus, adde Lupum.
Exoneraturas ventrem mihi vilica malvas
Attulit et varias, quas habet hortus, opes.
In quibus est lactuca sedens et tonsile porrum:

N ee deest ructatrix mentha nec herba salax.

Secta coronabunt rutatos ova lacertos
Et madidum thynni de sale sumen erit.

2.] The true reading here seems
doubtful, and the meaning is ob-
scure. We have jamque apparently
used for jam 111 356. 6, so that the
sense may be, ‘and now the troops
armed with the pilum (the short
and heavy Roman javelin) are re-
turning and entering upon guard?
This ie commonly r·efer1ed to the
change of the praetorian guards (ex-
cubiae) before the palace, which is
supposed (but not known) to have
taken placeat that hour. 01 redit may
refer to the leaving guard. In this
case xxe must supply castra with
sulnt. Others, w1th equal plobzbllitv

as a 0011001100, ‘et pilata ieditjam

3, 4.] This passage shows that the
hottest baths were frequented at

noon, those of a less temperature at ‹

one, and the tepid baths at two—'she
baths of Nero were the most famous3
see Ep 12114, · Neronianas 1110 re-
frig elat thermas: and vii. 34. 5,

‘gQuid Nerone pejus? Quid thermis

of these guests is made 111 Μαι-11111.-

The teclinical word, as Pliny, Ep. i.
15, ‘heus tu promittis ad cenam nec

venis.' Cf. Ep. 617. 2.

6. siyma] A semi- circular sofa in
the shape of the letter C (as the
Greek Σ was generally written 111
later ages). So 111 xiv. 87, ‘Accipe

Octo capit, veniat quisquis amicus
erit.' It was adapted to the shape of
the citrei orbes, or 0110111111· dining-
tables. See Rich, Dict. int It 15
clear that the hexaclinon' 111 Ep p. 476.

according to its size it held six, seven,
or eight guests. —L lupum, see Ep. 601.
