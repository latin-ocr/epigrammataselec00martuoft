OF THE POET. xiii

By the Emperor Domitian, whom he every where flattcrs
with a servility that sounds to our ears positively ridi-
culous, he was held in high estimation as an author3
and he was also patronized by two very influential
members of the emperor’s household, Parthenius and
Burrus. Priscus Terentius, Stella the poet, Faustinus,
Julius Cerealis, Julius Proculus, Julius Martialis, Atedius
Melior', were also among his wealthy patrons3 and from
some of these, or perhaps 111 part from the sale of his
poems, which were very successful, both in Rome and
in all the provinees³‚ he obtained a farm and villa, to
which he often alludes, at Nomentum, on the borders of
the Sabine territory. A frequent theme in Martial’s epi·
grains is the games in the amphitheatre, i. 0. in the great
Colosseum then recently erected3 in the collection of
epigrams commonly prefixed to the editions, and known
as ‘Liber Spectaculorum,’ or ‘De Spectaculis Libellus’
(though the genuineness of them is rather doubtful),
this is exclusively the subject. The information to be
derived from these, both as to the kinds of beasts im-
ported to Rome, to be either baited or exhibited, and the
marvellous degree of taniiug to which even lions and
wild bulls were brought, is as curicus as it is copious and
valuable. The emperor, as we know also from Suetonius ⁴,
took the greatest interest in these exhibitions, as well as
in the games in the Circus. To flatter and please him,
Martial would do and say any thing. Among the marks
of favour 110 obtained from Domitian were the jus trium
liberorum ⁵ (which at this time, as in Trajan's reign Β, was
