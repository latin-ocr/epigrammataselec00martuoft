(x. ivi.)

A witty reproof to one who exacted too much §ewice from his clients.

Totis, Galle, iubes tibi me servire diebus
Et per Aventinum ter quater ire lutum.
Eximit aut reficit dentem Cascellius aegrum,
Infestos oeulis uris, Hygine, pilos3
Non secat et tollit stillantem Fannius uvam, 5
Tristia servorum stigmata delet Eros ;
Enterocelarum fertur Podalirius Hermes:
Qui sanet ruptos die mihi, Galle, quis est?

medies to be found for tooth-ache
