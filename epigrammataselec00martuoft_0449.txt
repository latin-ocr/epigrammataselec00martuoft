ΕΡ. 663. (XII. xlviii.)

On the insincere friendship of those who gave dinners to obtain legaeies.
m with selfish ends in view. The poet says hc prefers a plain chop with a
friend to the finest dinner given in display, oras a favour.

Boletos et aprum si tanquam vilia poniS‚

Et non esse putas haec mea vota, volo.
Si fortunatum fieri me credis et heres

Vis scribi propter quinque Lucrina, vale.
Lauta tamen cena est : fatcor, lautissima, scd cras

Nil erit, immo hodic, protinus immo nihil,
Quod sciat infelix damnatae spongia virgae,

Vel quicunque canis iunctaque testa viae.
Mullorum leporumque et suminis exitus hic est,

Sulphureusque color carnificesque pedes.

Non Albana mihi sit comissatio tanti,
Nec Capitolinae pontificumque dapes.
Imputet ipse deus nectar mihi, fiet acetum,

l. Boletos] Ep. 335. 12. ‘If you
serve these delicacies not as deli-
cacies, but as your ordinary fare,
and not because you fancy 1 am
fond of them (which would put me
under obligations to you), then Ι
am willing to dine with you.' The
contrary is insen-ed: ⁶1f, however,
you give these viands merely because
they are expensive‚ and because you
think I am very glad to get them,
then farewell.’

3. fortunatum fieri] ‘ If you think
Ι am coming in for af01-tune,nnd
am in a position to leave you some-
thing in my will ; and if in fact you
want to be made my heir for half-a-
dozen oysters caten at your table,
then l beg to decline?

5. Lauta tamen cena est] This
appears to be said by thc host. The
reply is, that however good the
dinner may bc, it is only a tem-
porary cnjoyment: no permanent
obligation is confcrred by it.

7. Quod sciat] ⁶ As the poor
aponge may soon know to its cost.'
A sponge affixed to a stick (like our
mop) seems to have been used for

wiping, if any untoward mishap oc-
curred. Sec Ar. Ran. 482, άλ λ’ οἶσε
πρὸς τὴν καρδίαν μου σπογγιάν.

8, canis] Any dog that may chance
‘to pass by vomit on the ground.—
tesstz, see Ep. 323. 2.

9.] He goes on to show that good
diuncrs are also hurtful in thei}
after effects3 that they bring bilious-
nme. pallor, and gout. So in 468. 8,
‘ructat adhuc aprum pallida Roma
meumst—carnifices, ⁴ t01·turing.'

ll. Albana-comissatio] Domi-
tian was in the habit of giving:
grand dinncrs at his Alban villa on
the feast of his Patroness Minerva,
quinquatrus, Ep. 160. 5.

12. (θψίίυίιήακη A banquct was
sorved by the Epulones in honour
of Jupiter in the Capitol.-—ponl{fi-
cum, cf. Hor. Carm. ii. 14. 28,
‘Pontificum potiore cenis?

13. Impulet] ⁴ If Jove himself
were to give rne nectar, and reckon
it as a favour, it would become
vinegar to nic, and no better than
common Tuscan wine.' For im-
putare, sec Ep. 113. 3.
