M. VAL. MARTIALIS

Frontis et humorem colliget usque tuae.
Omnia laudabit, mirabitur omnia, donec
Perpessus dieas taedia mille “Veni !'’

to touch such nasty stum-Fumosae,
set in the smoke to be mellowed,

‘funium bibere institutae,' Hor.
Carni. iii. 8. 11.

14. Veni] ‘Dine with me.' See
Ep. 617. 2. This is extol-ted in sels-
defence‚ to get rid of the man's tii-e-
eome officiousness.

ΕΡ. 683. (XII. lxxxvii.)

On a shabby-genteel man who pretended that he had twice lost his din-
ner-show, as an excuse for coming without them.

Bis Cotta soleas perdidisse se questus,

Dum negligentem ducit ad pedes vernam,

Qui solus inopi restat et facit turbam,

Excogitavit homo sagax et astutus,

Ne faeere posset tale saepius damnum: 5
Exealeiatus ire coepit ad cenam.

ὲ. soleas] See Ep. 143. 3, and
685.. 6Dum—ducit] ‘ Through bring-
ing a careless slave as his attendant.'
33.11¹}{³1·.¹;-1?.·3’ &2¹52ss afflig? ἐξ
mg: Qui solus] ‘ The only slave the
poor [naahas left him, {nd who con-
stitutos is company ' yreoe, comi-
tmzs)Ea.-c09itavit] He means that the

excuse itself was the ingenious liez
but he pretends that the ingenuity
consisted in coming without dinner-
shoes at all. The fact wne, the man
never possessed them.

6. Eoecalcz'atus] The same as dis-
calciatus, ‘without walking-shoes.'
The calceus was the walking-shoe3
the solea the slipper οι· sandal for the
house. The joke is heightened by
the pretended loss of soleae excusing
the use even of calcei.

ΕΡ. 684. (XII. lxxxviii.)

Tongilianus habet nasum:

scio, non nego. Sed iam

Nil praeter nasum Tongilianus habet.

l. Tonyilicznus] Perhaps the same
οε in Ep. 144, and the Tonyillus of
Juv, vii. 130, where there seems to be
a joke on the nasus rhinocerotis, Ep.

2. 6.-}mhet nusum, as in Ep. 21. 18,

means, in another sense, that he has
satirical wit; but then, the poet add s,
he has nothing else. Amvxrcntly,
this is a satire on the mnn's poverty.
or his want of education.
