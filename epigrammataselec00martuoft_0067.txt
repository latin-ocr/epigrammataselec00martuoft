Male collocare si bonas voles horas
Et invidebis otio tuo, lector,

A Valeriano Polio petes Quinto,

Per quem perire non lieet meis nugis.

et si quid vilius istis,v These were
the names of two ancient and de-
populated towns in Apulia3 hence
they came 10 mean ‘res nihili.q So
merae tricae, Petronius. Sat. ξ 53.-
nec ipse, ne ipsc quiden13 which Ι
have mysclf foi-gotten, or should
fail 1ο recognize as my own.

3. male] ‘If you want 10 make a

bad use of vahiable time, and aro
disposed 10 grudge your own leisure
(i. e. dcsirous tc abuse it), you may
ask for theni from Quintus (a book-
seller), who does not allow my early
trifles to be foi-gotten.'——per quem,
the usual idion] with licet, as ‘per
me licct‚' διο.

ΕΡ. 59. (I. cxiv.)

This and Ep. 61 are addressed 10 Martial's wealthy friend Faustinus
(Ep. 148), and contain a soinewhat disguised request, that he will not
acquire possession of a small sarni, in which Fenius Telesphorus, who was
probably alibertus, had buricd a favourite daughter. From Ep. 193, it is
inferred that 1110 estate of Faustinus was at Tibur.

Hos tibi vicinos, Faustine, Telesphorus hortos
Faenius et breve rus udaque prata tenet.

Condidit hie natae eineres nomenque sacravit
Quod legis Antullae, dignior ipse legi.

Ad Stygias aequum fuerat pater isset ut umbras : 5
Quod quia non licuit, vivat, ut ossa eolat.

praenomen, taken by the slave when

4. ἅίῃηίον [effi] As the senior7 it
was more fitting that his name
should be inscribed on the tomb
than his daughter's.

ΕΡ. 60.

5. aequum βΙζὶιρναΐ] εἰκὸς ἦν. As
1110 law of Fate dcci-ced that the
father should survive the child, says
the poet⁷ may he live on—not in-
deed 10 cnjoy life, but-to bring
offerings 10 her tomb. These tei-se
expressions have great pathos, which
suffers by the rendering.
