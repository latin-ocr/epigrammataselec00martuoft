EPIGRAMMATA.

ΕΡ. 469. (IX. xiix.)
On the toga presented to the poet by Parthenius (Ep. 407. 16).

Haeo est illa meis multum cantata libellis,
Quam meus edidicit lector amatque togam.

Partheniana fnit quondam, memorabile vatis
Munus: in hae iham conspiciendus eques,

Dum nova, dum nitida fulgebat splendida lana

δι

Dumque erat auctoris nomine digna sui ;
Nune anus et tremulo vix accipienda tribuli,
Quam possis niveam dicere iure tuo.
Quid non longa dies, quid non consumitis anni?
Haec toga iam non est Partheniana, mea est. 10

l. multum. cantata] He exagge-
rates, as if he had written so often
about this toga, that the reader had
learnt by heart its whole history and
had become fond of it as a theme.

3. qnondam] Once—which from its
present condition you would hardly
believe—this was the toga sent me
by Parthenius—vatis. Parthenius
was himselfa poet. See Ep. 217. 23
644. l.--etlztes, see Ep. 224. 2.

5. nitida] Clean aud mossy-auc-
toris nomine diffica- This seems a
play on candida, as in Ep. 407. 16,
‘ non sunt Parthenio candidiora suo?
There is probably also an allusion to
παρθένος, as the Romans said rimo
aqua, charta, &c.. and the Greeks
παρθένος ψυχὴ, Eur. Hipp. 1006.

7. Nune anus] Here there is an
iinplicd opposition to παρθένος.
‘ AVow it is old, and hardly fit to give
to a tottering paupe1·.' By tribulis
one of a tribe is meant, i.e. not
capite census, but merely described
by the tribe in which he is enrolled.
So inf. ix. 57. 8, ‘nec pallens toga
mortui tribulis.' Hor. Epist. i. 13.
15, ‘ut cum pileolo soleas conviva
tribulis.'

8. jure tuo] ‘ On your own antho-
1·ity,' or by your own right. Ifyou say
it is white, and it isn't, you are re-
sponsible for the assertion. For a
play on nivea toya see Ep. 178.

10. mea est] ⁴ It is my own,' viz.
suited to my own poverty rather than
to Parthenius' wealth and splendour.

ΕΡ. 470. (ix. 1.)

The subjectis nearlv the sanie as Ep. 102, to which the present has a

close resemblance.

'l‘his Gaurus (like Accius Labeo) had composed a

stupid epit: in twelve books on the Trojan war.

Ingenium mihi, Gaure, probas sio esse pusillum,
Carmina quod faciam quae brevitate placent.
Confiteor; sed tu bis senis grandia libris
Qui scribis Priami praelia, magnus homo es.

2. bra-itare placent] As if they had
uo other merit.
