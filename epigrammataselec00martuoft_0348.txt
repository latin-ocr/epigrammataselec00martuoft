ΕΡ. 509.

M. VAL. MARTIALIS

(x. iii.)

On some obscure poet, who had passed off some scurrilous epigrama as

Martial's.

To the same subject Ep. 511 alludes.

Vernaculorum dieta, sordidum dentem,

Et foeda linguae probra circulatricis,

Quae sulphurato nolit empta ramento

Vatiniorum proxeneta fractorum,

Poeta quidam clancularius spargit 5

Et volt videri nostra.

Credis hoc, Prisce,

Voce ut loquatur psittacus coturnicis
Et concupiscat esse Canus ascaules?
Procul a libellis nigra sit meis fama,

Quos rumor alba gemmeus vehit pinna.

Cur ego laborem notus esse tam prave,
Constare gratis cum silentium possit?

l. vernaculorum] ‘ Buffoons,' ⁴ jes-
ters.' From verna, in reference to
the free and easy language of house
slaves, vernae procaces, Ep. 21. ¹2.
Suet. Vitell. xiv ‚ ‘ nullis infensior,
quam vernaculis et mathematicis,
ut quisque deferretur, inauditum ca-
pite puniebat? — sordidam dentem,
‘low satire.' The writing itself is
called dens, because it inssicts the
wound.

2. foeda, &c.] ‘The low slang of
a gossipping gypsy-woman' (as we
should say), ἀγύρτρια, a strolling
fortune-‘cellen or beggar-woman.

3. nolit empta] ⁵ Such as the
vendor of broken glass vessels would
not care to buy for a sulphur match,'
i. e. he would give nothing for even
the paper they are written on. See
Epp. 21. 43 669. l4.- Vatinius was
a cobbler of Beneventum. who gave
his name to a certain manufacture
of glass ware. See Juv. v. 46, and
Mr. Mayor's noteg aud inf. lib. xiv.
96, ‘ vilia sutoris calicem monimenta
Vatini Accipc.'—pro.reneta, προ-
{mn-ripe, one 'who negotiates or
transacts business for another. The
man who disposes of broken glas!

in exchange for matches would not
buy with those matches, though they
eost him nothing, such worthless
stuf-'f as these verses—clancularius,
clandestinus, a hole-and-corner poet.

6. volt, δῖα] ‘ He wishes it to be
thought that they are mine‚' perhaps
from imitating Martial's style. In
Ep. 330. 2, the poet distinctly dis-
avows the slandering of even his
enemies.

7. ut loquatur] This is unusual
for credis loqui. We may supply
fieri posse, or verum. esse. The sense
is. ‘a parrot is as likely to spcak
with the harsh voice of a quail. or
Caum, the celebrated flute-player.
to perform on the bag-pipes, as Ι am
to turn low satiristst Canus is men-
tioned in iv. 5. 8, as in high popular
favour.

10. rumor—yemmeus] The exact
figure of speech is not quite clear3
whether from a white stone 01· gem
(Ep. 608. l) contrasted with ablack
oue, or from the spangles in apea-
cock's mih—vehit, ‘raises aloft,'
κουφίζει, μετεωρίζει.
