Nou totam mihi, si vacabit, horam,

Dones et licet imputes Severe,

Dum nostras legis exigisque nugas.

‘⁶ Durum est perdere ferias :'' rogamus,

Iacturam patiaris hane ferasque. 5
Quod si legeris ipse eum diserto

—Sed numquid sumus improbi ?—-—Secundo‚

Plus multo tibi debiturus hie est,

Quam debet domino suo libellus.

Nam securus erit, nee inquieta

Lassi marmora Sisyphi videbit,
Quem censoria eum meo Severo
Docti lima momorderit Secundi.

1. non totam] ‘Something less than
an hour, if you shall have one to
spare‚1 ask you to give me, and Ι
allow you to reckon it as against me,
for reading and criticising these my
little effusionsf-eaez'yere is said of
critics; so Ep. ⁵212. 4, ‘ nil exactius
eruditiusque est.'

4.] You reply‚ ‘ 'tis hard to lose
one's holiday.' ‘ True, but we make
it a request that you will bear pa-
tiently this loss ³

7. numquid sumus] ‘ Are we pre-
suming too much to expect another
to do a similar favour under similar
circumstances?' This Secundus ap-
pears to be the same as the one men-

tioned in Ep. l. 7, ‘ Libertum docti
Lucensis quaere Secundum.' Severus
is mentioned, Ep. 622.

8. plus multo, &c.] This book
will owe much more to you (for re-
vising) than to the owner (i. e. au—
thor, for writing it).'—-For domium*
libri, see Ep. 27. 6.

10. securus erit] It will have no-
thing to sear from the remarks of
captious and malignant people, as de-
scribed in Ep. 2. This fate he com-
paressto Sitsyph‘ps’ stone—videbit, i. e.
it wi no e amna us.

The Saturnalia ’ind the lst of March (

the first of the old ten-months

Roman year) were the principal times for sending mutual presents ς but οιι
the latter, as appears from Tibull. iii. l„ the men sentpresents to the women.

Here the poet t

reatens that he will then repay Galla iu kind for forgetting

him now, viz. he will send her nothing.

Iam tristis nucibus puer relictis
Clamoso revocatur a magistro,
Et blando male proditus fritillo,

l. ηιιοίῘηιε-νεῖἰείίε] Leaving his revocas. ego adhuc Saturnalia ex-
playthings, i. e. the nuts asa substi- tenda—Clamoso, see Ep. 669. 5.
