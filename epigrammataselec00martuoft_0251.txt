Martial hopes that Celer, who had governed Celtiberia with great pru-
(lence and ixnpartialsty, is pleased with his poenis⁷ which Auens had
recited to hini, and says he looks on him as a critic. rather than a mere
listener. There is a Celer mentioned as a. plagiarist in lib. i. 63.

Gratum est, quod Celeri nostros legis, Auete, libellos,
Si tamen et Celerem quod legiS‚ Auete, iuvat.

Ille meas gentes et Celtas rexit Hiberos,
Nee fuit in nostro certior orbe fides.

Maior me tanto reverentia turbat, et aures 5
Non auditoris, iudicis esse puto.

Umber had sent off to Martial, under the convoy of eight tall slaves, all
the paltry gists that had been given him in the Saturnalia. Martial says,

pounds of silver!
