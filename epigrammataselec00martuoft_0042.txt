verse) Compare Ep. 7 with 15, 28 with 32, 8 with 41, 59 with 61, &c-

Edita ne brevibus pereat mihi eura libellis,
Dicatur potius Τὸν δ’ ἀπαμειβόμενος.

ΕΡ. 25. (I. xlix.)

To Licinianus, a friend and country man of the poets, and iobably a
lawyer of some iepute (sce vei 37), ifnot an author (Ep. 31. ll). Pliny
(Epist. iv. ll) mentions 3 V alerius licinianus ,as p‘raetorius inter eloquen-
tissimos causarum actores habitusss but as having incurred the anger of
Domitian and been exiled. A touching story is added, but by no mean
creditable to Licinianus. It· is uncextain, however, if the persons are th(-
same. He appears to have contemplated a return to Spain, and the poet
congratulates him in very lively language on the pleasuies that aw ait him.

Vir Celtiberis non tacende gent-ibus
Nostraeque laus Hispaniae,
Videbis altam, Liciniane, Bilbilin,
Equis et armis nobilem,
Senemque Gaium nivibus, effractis sacrum t,
Vadaveronem montibus,
Et delicati dulce Boterdi nemus,
Pomona quod felix amat.
Tepidi natabis lene Congedi vadum
Mollesque Nympharum lacus, ιο
Quibus remissum corpus astringes brevi
salone, qui ferrum gelat.
