ΕΡ. 367. (VII. lxiv.)

Cinnamus (Ep. 284), a noted barber, afterwards enriched by some lady un-
known (cf. Juv. l. ⁶25, ‘ Patricios omnes opibus quum provocet unus, Quo
tondente gravis juveni mihi barba sonabat,' supposed to be the same), had
either voluntarily retii-cd, or been banished to Sicily. ‘ What are you to ‹lo
there,' says Martial, ‘in your run-awayr rest? You have no knowledge
ofany other art or science, and you must sink to the barber again)

Qui tonsor tota fueras notissimus urbe,
Et post hoe dominae munere factus eques,

Sicanias urbes Aetnaeaque regna petisti,
Cinname, cum fugeres tristia iura fori.

Qua nune arte graves tolerabis inutilis annos? 5
Quid facit infelix et fugitiva quies?

Nou rhetor, non grammaticus ludive magister,
Non Cynicus, non tu Stoicus esse potes,

Vendere nec vocem Siculis plausumque theatris:
Quod superest, iterum, Cinname, tonsor eris. 10

ΕΡ. 368. (VII. lxv.)

Martial ridicules the folly of Gargilianusi, who had spent twenty years
and a fortune in prosecuting one suit in the three courts ofjustice. ⁶ Wh0‚·
says he, ‘ would litigate for twenty years. when he could at once throw
up the cause, and escape so much trouble aud vexation thereby ?'

Lis te bis decimae numerantem frigora brumae
Conterit una tribus, Gargiliane‚ foris.

Ah miser et demens! viginti litigat annis
Quisquam, cui vinci, Gargiliane, licet?

2. tribus—foris] cf. Ep. 135. 4. 4. Quisquam, &e.] Ep, 230. 14.

ΕΡ. 369. (vn. lxvi.)

Heredem Fabius Labienum ex asse reliquit:
Plus meruisse tamen se Labienus ait.

’2. Plus meruisse] Because he had captator, cf. iv. 56, ‘ Munera quod
spent more in presents to his friend senibus viduisque ingentia mittis,
when he lived, than he now re· Vistemunificum Gargiliane vocem?
ccived from him when he was dead, Sordidius nihil est, nihil est te
although he gave him all he had spurcius un0, Qui potes insidia«
to leave. For this device of the dona vocare tuas!
