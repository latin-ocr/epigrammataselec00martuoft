EPIG RAMMATA.

159

Cui comparatus indecens erat pavus,
Inamabilis sciurus et frequens phoenix:
Adhuc recenti tepet Erotion busto,

Quam pessimorum lex amara fatorum

15

Sexta peregit hieme, nec tamen tota,
Nostros amores gaudiumque lususque.

Et esse tristem me meus vetat Paetus,
Pectusque pulsans pariter et comam vellens:

‘⁶ Deflere non te vernulae pudet mortem?

20

Ego coniugem’' inquit “extuli et tamen vivo,
Notam, superbam, nobilem, locupletem.’'

Quid esse nostro fortius potest Paeto?
Ducentiens accepit, et tamen vivit.

12. indecens] Unsightly. Cf. Ep.
2¹25. ῖς 335. IL—erut, for esset,-
so in Viro. Georg. ii. 133, ‘si non
jactaret—Taurus erat.'

13. sciurus] σκιὰ and οὐρὰ,
maim-el. Our word is from sciu-
rel us.

14. Erotion] This is in apposition
with puella, in ver. l.—tepet, either
from the pile, or perhaps as only
just dead3 for ‘terra clauditur in-
ians Et minor igne rogi,' Juv. xv.
139, though this probably refers to

mere babies.
16. tota] See Ep. 490. 5.
19. pariter] So as to match my

grief. ef. E . 70. 5.

20. 'vernn ae] Contemptuously
said, and op osed to nobilem.

22. locup rtem] He purposely puts
last a quality which with him stood
far the first. The irony on the man's
affected stoicism is intense. Cf.
Epjfibbucmtiens] 20,000 sestertia,
ο]- above 160,000l.

ΕΡ. 244. (V. xxxviii.)

Two brothers claimed to sit on the knights' scats, on the strength of a

knight's fortune divided between them.

The poet says, one might be an

eques without the other, or they may take it in turn to sit among the

equites.

Calliodorus habet censum—quis nescit ?—equestrem‚
Sexte, sed et fratrem Calliodorus habet.
Quadringenta secat, qui dicit σῦκα μέριζε;
Uno credis equo posse sedere duos?

l. Calliodorus] Sec Ep. 532.-
quis nescii, i.e. he takes care that
every one shall know it.

3] ‘ That man divides a knight's
fortune, who tells me to share a fig,'
i. e. it is as vain to do one as the

other. To divide a fig (or, as wo
say, ⁸ to make two bites ofa cherry ')
seems to have been a proverb for
attempting to share what is hardly
enough for one. But here, perhaps,
we should read Quadrinyenta seca
